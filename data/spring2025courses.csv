ESS234,"Climate Displacement, Migration, and Mobility (HUMRTS 224)",,"Addressing climate displacement is one of the central sustainability challenges facing current and future generations. The climate crisis is already driving people to move.  According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, approximately 31.8 million people around the world were displaced by floods, storms, fires, and other weather-related hazards in 2022 alone. Coastal communities in the U.S. and beyond are already in the process of planning relocation to escape erosion, rising sea levels, and other slow-onset effects of climate change. Displacement has significant economic, social, psychological, and cultural costs. Yet persistent knowledge gaps on these costs and how to mitigate them impede the efforts of leaders, advocates, and policymakers who face climate displacement challenges today. Join us for a one-unit seminar as we explore how to make sense of the human impacts of climate change on individuals, communities, and governments - and, in particular, on the ways in which the climate crisis is already forcing people to move or reconfigure their communities. Joined by a series of guest speakers who bring personal, policy, and scholarly expertise to this emerging issue, this seminar will speak to the phenomena of both internal and cross-border migration driven by climate change. The seminar will focus on both understanding the challenges that come with the climate crisis as well as proposed solutions to these challenges and opportunities for correcting past injustices and harms. Possible thematic focuses for our discussions include: (1) Legal, policy and governance implications of internal versus cross-border displacement, (2) The nexus of climate with conflict/public health/agriculture as drivers of migration, (3) Individual- vs. community-centric displacement solutions (e.g., household buyouts vs. community planned relocations), and (4) Indigenous sovereignty and rights in context of climate-related migration.",1-2,Satisfactory/No Credit,SEM,Thursday,1:30:00 PM - 2:50:00 PM,Departmental Room,Chris Field; Rwaida Gharib; Janet Martinez,No

ESS326,Cloud and Aerosol: From Microphysics to Climate Change,,"Cloud and aerosol in the atmosphere are critical components in the weather and climate systems. They are also considered as the leading uncertainty sources in the current climate change assessment. The purpose of this course is to introduce the laws of the thermodynamics that drive the changes in temperature, moisture, and the energy conversions, and the physics of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation (also known as &quot;microphysics&quot;). Understanding these processes on multiple time and space scales is crucial to gain insights of the Earth's mean climate change as well as weather and climate extreme events (like heavy precipitation, lightning, hail). The advancement of atmospheric physics depends on observations from a variety of platforms (in situ, ground-based, and remote sensing), providing massive amounts of information regarding the evolving state of the atmosphere. These observational data are then fed into numerical models of the atmosphere, which play an increasingly important role in decision-making, from short-term forecasts of hazardous weather to long-term policy implications of global climate change. The course will discuss the state-of-the-art observations and numerical models related with aerosol, cloud, and precipitation.

SUST261,Art and Science of Decision Making,,"When we make high-quality decisions, we improve the probability of outcomes we want. By combining the art of qualitative framing and structuring with the science of quantitative assessment and analysis, we will have pragmatic ways to: identify those core issues driving the value of our decisions, craft an inspirational vision, create viable alternatives, mitigate biases in probabilistic information, clarify both tangible and intangible preferences, develop appropriate risk/reward models, evaluate decisions for a broad range of uncertain scenarios, appraise values of gathering additional information, and ensure commitment to implementation plans and budgets. Common-sense rules and decision-making tools provide the essential focus, discipline, and passion we need for clarity of action on big, important decisions ? from personal choices to organizational decisions about business strategies or public policies. A normative approach prescribes how decisions can be made defensible using a logical basis of deliberative reasoning when we face a dynamic, complex, and uncertain future world. Transformational change can then implement the optimal decisions by following a dynamic process of project management. Course requirements include a midterm exam, a final exam, and an individual, quarter-long tutorial to frame, structure, assess, and analyze your personal career and lifestyle decisions for the initial 5 years after leaving Stanford. Key factors often include net discretionary income, savings and investments, macroeconomic trends, job satisfaction, personal life satisfaction, avocation pursuits, and relationships with family and friends. To achieve your desired results in this course, you are implored by the teaching team to &quot;procrastinate your procrastination.&quot;",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),LEC,"Tuesday, Thursday",9:30:00 AM - 11:20:00 AM,,Burke Robinson,Yes

BUSGEN100,Triple Bottom Line: Managing Sustainable Value Creation,,"This course introduces and operationalizes the Triple Bottom Line framework for measuring and managing sustainable value creation. The framework highlights the balance that needs to be achieved by an organization across three dimensions of sustainability-related performance - environmental stewardship, social impact, and value creation - and provides a powerful lens for both evaluating the firm's current activities and designing a business strategy with sustainability at the core of its value proposition. The first half of the course focuses on developing skills to use financial statement disclosures, sustainability-related reports, and other publicly available and private sources of information to critically evaluate a company's economic performance and financial condition (i.e., the value creation dimension of the Triple Bottom line) and to measure and assess how a company's operations interacts with the environment and society (i.e., the environmental stewardship and social responsibility dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line). The second half of the course will focus on applying the Triple Bottom Line analyses to specific decision contexts, and will examine the measurement issues, trade-offs, and implementation challenges associated with identifying and executing a sustainability-oriented business strategy. The course is structured to develop students&iquest; ability to critically assess the sustainability-related performance of an organization and to ultimately translate that understanding into specific recommendations to improve that company along each dimension of sustainability. The perspective taken is that of an executive relying on available financial and non-financial information for performance evaluation, investment analyses, and strategic decision making purposes, yet the concepts and tools can also be applied by investors who need to understand whether or not the organization's activities are sustainable.

We will then turn to understanding recent developments in machine learning and AI, from the point of view of an informed user (rather than a technical developer), ranging from foundation language models to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) implemented using blockchain technology. These will form the basis for an ongoing discussion about the future of organizations in the age of AI. Is this merely another phase in the modern organization's evolution, is this a paradigmatic redefinition of its structure and function, or is this a cataclysmic moment heralding the end of organizations as the central building blocks of economic activity? We will (speculatively) discuss these issues from a broad perspective, investigating how AI is already impacting work and organizational structures, as well as these changes' broader social implications (such as their effect on work/life balance, the gendered division of labor in the household, and the structure of community). The implications for business and management are clear: AI is already impacting organizational life, and will continue to do so as technologies mature and their business models are refined.

FINANCE632,International Finance and Macroeconomics,,"This is an advanced graduate-level course in international finance and macroeconomics. The course focuses on empirical methods, stylized facts, new advances in large-scale empirical work, and applied theory. This course is targeted to advanced second year PhD students. The course assumes familiarity with the basics of graduate-level macroeconomics and finance. Students without the necessary familiarity with these techniques are welcome to take the course, but should expect to have to fill the gaps on their own (and with the help of their classmates!). Given the target audience above, the course has three main objectives. 1) To introduce and investigate both classic and new economic issues at the frontier of current research in international finance and macroeconomics. The purely pedagogical part of the course aims to make students familiar with the questions, the current state of research, and the empirical tools currently being used. 2) To create a mental framework and intuitive understanding of important and active questions. What makes a question interesting? What makes a paper a good paper? How to develop a reasoned view of new (and perhaps yet un-studied) issues in international finance and macroeconomics? This objective is less direct and less formal, but aims to transition the students into full-time researchers. 3) To kick-start students on independent research. For those interested in applied work the course makes you familiar and tries to connect you with existing data at the frontier of the field, both public and proprietary. For those interested in theoretical work the course staff acts as a sounding board for early research ideas.",4,GSB Student Option LTR/PF,CAS,"Monday, Thursday",10:30:00 AM - 11:50:00 AM,,Luigi Bocola; Matteo Maggiori,No

We examine the past, present, and future of the complex political economy surrounding real estate finance, its impact on markets, and the business challenges and opportunities arising from it, both domestically and abroad, before and after the financial crisis. We then tackle recent trends like the rise of shadow banks, fintech, and proptech.

Reputation Management will explore how you can effectively communicate to create, adapt and maintain your personal reputation. Your reputation remains fluid as you navigate your career decisions and interact with different professionals along your journey. The course is designed along three interlocking elements: reputation management literature, relevant case studies, and curated guest speakers. Students will learn the fundamentals of strategic corporate communication and the risk of not managing reputation effectively. These frameworks will be extended with specific case studies to illustrate where individuals, groups, and firms have faced the challenge of managing reputation effectively. We will focus on both traditional and virtual components of communication including the relevancy of online reputation management. Finally we will invite well-known leaders from a range of industries who have built and sustained their reputations, through effective communication. Each leader has had to manage their reputations in the public eye, and alongside their peers, supervisors, and employees. Guests will be invited to discuss their conscious and unplanned strategies of how to successfully communicate the kind of person, leader, innovator, or public figure they strive to be. Students will benefit from a rich blend of frameworks, cases, and speakers enabling them to successfully enter the work force and create their own, personal reputations. Students will create a case study drawn from their own experience (or personal network), of a reputation dilemma. A final assignment requires students to research their own reputation history by projecting what they think their reputation is, creating their own survey for friends, colleagues and employers to take, conduct three interviews about their personal reputation with three individuals who have worked closely with them, and then synthesize all this feedback into a cohesive paper and short video that reflects their authentic work and personal reputation.

GSBGEN357,U.S.-China: Strategic Competition and Cooperation,,"This is a course to help future business leaders understand the policy risks that result from the changing relationship between the United States and China. Driven in part by policy decisions over the past decade in Washington and Beijing, the world built by the West after World War II is changing. Most American policymakers now label the relationship between the U.S. and China as one of strategic competition. They are often less clear on whether this term applies to the governments, the peoples, the businesses based within each country, or the two nation-states. At the same time, these two superpowers also have shared interests. We seek to understand the changing relationships between the U.S. and China, and what both competition and possible cooperation between their governments mean for others. American business leaders may be caught between two governments with conflicting interests. Business leaders in other countries may be caught among three governments: America, China, and their home-country government. This is a course not about China per se, but instead about the interactions between these two superpowers' governments and policies. We will look at the U.S.-China relationship by unpacking and examining distinct elements, devoting 1 or 2 class sessions on each topic. Relying in part on guests with practical expertise in some element of the U.S.-China relationship, our goals are to understand: * The most significant changes in Chinese policy direction in the Xi era; * Changes among Western leaders' policy approaches as they have realized their 50-year-old policy toward China either was wrong or is now out-of-date; * What the strategic competition label might mean and how it could translate into specific policy changes in both countries; * What opportunities exist for cooperation and mutual benefit despite strategic competition; * How China might try to change the post-WWII international rules and organizations; * How leaders of global businesses, in the U.S., China, and other countries, are caught between these two governments; * What decoupling in certain industries might mean; and * Possible ways to think about these issues as the U.S.-China relationship evolves.",4,GSB Letter Graded,SEM,"Monday, Thursday",10:00:00 AM - 11:45:00 AM,,Keith Hennessey,No

Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSBGEN 514 is a seminar/discussion format in which students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions.

A focus throughout is the role of heterogeneity for both identification and firm decisions.  The class also considers simulation-based estimation and empirical pricing or advertising models.  The emphasis is on an intuitive understanding and coding and estimation of entry-level models of consumer behavior.",3,GSB Letter Graded,SEM,Wednesday,2:50:00 PM - 5:50:00 PM,,Wesley Hartmann,No

GSBGID382,Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Leadership,,"In this course, you will learn the key principles of CFO leadership. The class will apply the foundations learned from prior finance and accounting classes and will put students in the shoes of CFOs navigating complex, high-stakes situations.  This class is for future CFOs and everyone who will work with CFOs - CEOs, senior executives, venture and private equity investors, board members, bankers, auditors, and regulators. The course will first cover the multiple aspects of the CFO&iquest;s role, including building a finance team, overseeing the financial systems and personnel, budgeting, and financial reporting. The second part of the course covers key decisions of the CFO, including making investment decisions and responding to business and macroeconomic crises.  The final part of the course covers capital raising decisions and interacting with shareholders, analysts, and activists. The teaching team, which includes former CFOs and an Accounting professor, will guide interactive discussion with CFO guest speakers from 15 different companies, including the CFOs of Meta, AirBnB, Meta, Walmart, Apple, and Costco.  CFOs from an additional 25 companies have also agreed to speak with student teams for the final case study project.

GSBGID503,The University (and Other Organizations) in Crisis,,"In addition to having leadership roles in corporations, investment firms, and other organizations, today's MBAs will be tomorrow's university trustees and major donors. They will find many of these institutions in a state of crisis involving identity, equality, and discourse. During the past half century, American universities and the leadership of major corporations have evolved from being largely white, male, and Protestant to becoming more diverse in many ways. However, some of the policies that have contributed to this progress are being abandoned or distorted. For example, the Supreme Court recently prohibited race-based affirmative action, a major vehicle for achieving diversity. And diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, originally designed to counter discrimination based on individuals' identities, have sometimes become vehicles for creating stark divisions among people with different identities. The university's missions of seeking truth and engaging in critical inquiry have been undermined by both progressive and conservative actors. Affective polarization has dramatically increased, and civil and critical discourse are in steep decline throughout society's institutions. Controversies about the war in Gaza have only exacerbated these problems. We will examine the nature and causes of these and related problems, and consider possible solutions for reducing polarization, restoring discourse, and achieving genuine equality. Although our main focus will be on institutions of higher education, we will also examine these issues in corporations and other organizational settings. In the conduct of the class, we will try to model civil, critical discourse. Students who opt to take the course for a grade will write a paper of approximately 10 single-spaced pages on any topic related to the course. Students who opt to take the course on a pass/fail basis will be assessed based on four reflection papers. In both cases, students' performance will also be evaluated based on class participation.",2,GSB Student Option LTR/PF,CAS,Tuesday,10:00:00 AM - 11:45:00 AM,,Paul Brest,No

Simply finding faults in other people's arguments can be counterproductive unless you are also willing to recognize faults in your own arguments. This course provides a setting for students to develop the skills needed to work better in group decision making. In this seminar we will analyze a set of issues that in various ways illustrate the types of problems that can interfere with quality decisions. The emphasis will be on: a) developing reasoned positions; b) making sound and compelling arguments that support those positions, c) learning and updating based on the sound and compelling arguments made by others and d) recognizing errors in reasoning made by self and others. The class will consist of a series of cases that require making a business decision. Students will work together to formulate reasoned arguments supporting their solution. The course grade will be jointly determined by how well students initially analyze the problem and how they then update their solutions based on the arguments made by others. Students will work in groups throughout. The class will satisfy the 'Engaging with Differences Requirement' (EDR).",2,GSB Letter Graded,CAS,"Monday, Thursday",4:25:00 PM - 6:10:00 PM,,Jonathan Berk,No
HRMGT210,Organizational Analytics,,"This course will bring you to the cutting edge of how organizations are (re)-designed using analytics. You will learn about a variety of tools which allow you to (1) better understand understanding what is happening in an organization, (2) forecast what is likely to happen in the future, based on sophisticated extrapolation of past data, and (3) prototype (i.e., conduct organizational A/B tests) to determine which decisions are likely to be successful based on pilot tests. These tools make for a major departure from the mainstream approach to organization design, which relies extensively on copying &iquest;best practices&iquest; from other companies, represents organizations as &iquest;boxes and arrows&iquest; organization charts, and is often obsessed with incentive compensation and reporting as the key organizational/HR decisions. Instead, you will learn how to use analytics to find out what works specifically for your company (rather than what worked in others), develop detailed models of interactions among employees (rather than among boxes) to help them collaborate successfully, and think of organization design as a combination of factors which can all be better understood through analytics. The course's goals are to make you more knowledgeable about the analytical tools which can help you design an organization, to give you frameworks to ask the right questions to data scientists and evaluate their work, and to help you make decisions based on the results of analyses. This is a hands-on class: we will rely extensively on group exercises, in which you will be able to learn enough about analytical tools and programming to be able to collaborate with analysts and evaluate their work. Who should take this course? If you are likely to be involved in strategy execution, post-merger integration, re-organizations, or HR in either a direct or advisory role (regardless of how big or small your company is), this course will put you at the cutting edge of thinking and methodology in these areas. Some of the exercises will involve programming (in the Python language, specifically). However, you DO NOT need to know statistics (beyond that covered in core courses) or computer programming to take and benefit from this course. We will provide technical support and will design exercises in a way that you can focus your energies on mastering the concepts and thinking of solving business problems.

As you get a handle on the principles, we'll then shift focus to experimenting with how you personally might respond in different scenarios. A key premise of the class is that different interpersonal styles can be equally effective in obtaining the desired outcome, but you need to identify what can work for you, from pacing to precise phrases. To facilitate this experimentation, you'll receive feedback with your peers and systematically reflect on the process. The lab will be co-taught by a lecturer with a long history of business negotiations. Several guests will visit to speak about negotiations in their particular area of expertise. As a final project, you will also develop a negotiation case.

This dynamic industry creates opportunities for entrepreneurial students interested in having a creative and/ or business impact on entertainment. This course is designed to help prepare students for careers in the media industries, and to explore leadership within them. The industry is truly an intersection of art and commerce, and the major portion of the course will involve bringing to the class leaders who represent key areas of the entertainment industry, on both the business and creative sides. As with any business, the entertainment industry is driven by the vision of its leaders. These leaders daily make financial and artistic decisions, and manage staff and productions with the goal of producing entertainment product meant to be seen as widely as possible, and to make a profit. It is hoped that through interaction with these speakers, students will see the potential of strong leadership and how it works to advance entertainment companies and the films and television programming they produce. Topics to be examined include project development; production, marketing and distribution; rising technologies such as AI, and its impact on the industry; the roles of studio, streaming, music, and gaming executives, directors, producers, television showrunners, writers, actors, talent managers, and others; the intersection of Silicon Valley and Hollywood; and managing creative teams. The class will also cover the social changes occurring in the industry, such as #MeToo, and the importance of leaders creating workplaces and entertainment product that is inclusive and ethical. The theory behind this course is that by listening to, and questioning the class speakers, coupled with class research papers, students will emerge with a deeper understanding of the entertainment industry. The class is also intended to give students a view of first-rate leadership in general, and to present what it takes to be a successful, inspiring, and forward-thinking leader in entertainment.",3,GSB Student Option LTR/PF,SEM,Monday,2:50:00 PM - 5:50:00 PM,,Bill Guttentag,No

The first part of the semester reviewing fundamental issues in the theory and measurement of the study of culture. We will examine the historical context of culture research in psychology and related disciplines, theoretical perspectives linking culture to behavior, methodological issues in conducting cross-cultural research, as well as recent research on the ways in which cultures vary and change. We will then examine how culture affects basic psychological processes, including cognition, emotion, and motivation, followed by how culture affects organizational phenomena. In the last five weeks of the class, we will examine how culture affects topics in organizational behavior, which will be chosen by the class. This class will increase your knowledge about other cultures, and will enable you to critically examine the cultural assumptions embedded in existing organizational theories. It will also provide tools for you to be able to develop and test your own theories in other cultures.

Modern human activity is known to be dramatically changing the earth's ecosystem with far-reaching consequences: altering the climate, reducing biodiversity, challenging our ability to provide sufficient food and water, increasing mass migrations, harming our oceans, threatening human health, and potentially leading to increasing violence and chances of war. Our ability to limit and adapt to these changes will depend on the behavior of organizations: corporations, not for profits, governments, non-governmental organizations, political advocacy and social movement organizations. The course organizes the various literatures of 'organization theory' that pertain to sustainability, giving the students an intellectual structure on which to build their own understanding.

OB655,The Psychology of Brokering,,"This seminar will explore the critical role that different kinds of brokers play in social and organizational networks. Brokers influence other parties' interactions and relationships across numerous contexts, from journalism, music production and trade, to migration, diplomacy, and dealmaking. Brokers transfer information, facilitate collaborations within organizations, and promote exchange between organizations. They spread gossip, shape labor market outcomes, and occasionally instigate conflict. Hence, to understand interactions and relationships in social and organizational contexts, we must understand the dynamics of brokering. We will discuss intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes related to brokering. Topics of discussion will include social influence, trust, and status, among other topics. We will read research from multiple disciplines, including cognitive, personality, and social psychology, sociology, political science, and management.

How do we detect and mitigate the effects of corruption? What role may modern finance play in creating or mitigating political economy challenges in developing countries?These problems are modern and endemic, but many are also old problems, and economic theory and the practical experiences of different countries have much to tell us both about what has worked in the past, and what policy experiments we may try in new environments. Rather than a survey, the objective of this course is to selectively discuss new and open research areas in political development economics and the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to contribute to them, with the topics chosen to complement other Stanford courses in applied microeconomics, development, political economics and economic history. By the end of the course, the student will have analysed a theoretical or historical solution to a key political development challenge and proposed a natural or field experiment to test it empirically.

In this class, we will analyze the economics and strategy of marketplaces. We will consider the forces that have led to the proliferation of these marketplaces, as well as the strategic choices that determine which ones succeed. We will also study the strategy of managing these marketplaces: how should matching work, how marketplace design can solve problems of congestion or market thinness, how to discover prices through auctions, and how to get feedback and design a well-functioning rating system. We will also talk about trust and safety as a key pillar of successful marketplaces. We will also learn how to design non-monetary markets that solve big social problems, such as kidney exchange, food banks, public housing, and school choice. Finally, we will discuss the regulatory challenges of these marketplaces, especially with regard to labor income and platform's monopoly power. Applications include online stores; ride-sharing and transportation; advertising and sponsored search; room-sharing and vacation rentals; creator/passion economy; B2B marketplaces; dating; and labor markets.

STRAMGT345,Impact: Taking Social Innovation to Scale,,"How do you get the best new social innovations to reach the hundreds of millions of people who need it the most? And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing 'the middle of the value chain.' This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems? The class is taught be Steve Davis, Senior Advisor at McKinsey &amp; Company, Senior Advisor at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and former CEO of PATH, IDRI, and Corbis. We take an interdisciplinary approach to look at the factors that pull innovation forward, push it from behind, and (often to the world's detriment) block its successful implementation and scaling. First grounding the discussion in research on innovation and social change, we then apply business principles, real world experiences and several important case studies in global health to examine the way good ideas get stuck, and how good ideas can turn into innovation that matters. We focus on root causes for failure, success factors, and business practices and tools to enable millions of lives to be impacted by social innovation. The seminar combines lectures, case studies, visiting practitioners and team projects focused on the business case for scaling specific social innovations. The goal is to help the next generation of social innovation leaders think more about some of the mistakes of the past, lessons for the future, and new ways of approaching old problems, all from a practitioner's point of view.",3,GSB Student Option LTR/PF,CAS,Tuesday,2:50:00 PM - 5:50:00 PM,,Stephen Davis,No

Everyday people must confront economic volatility, uncertain government policies, shifting global complexities, shrinking liquidity, rapid technology cycles, and challenging workforce dynamics. Importantly, this is confronting leaders who have never seen inflation, high interest rates or extended bad business cycles. This course explores how leaders at the world's leading companies are driving frame-breaking transformational change inside of organizations. In addition, in the emerging post-pandemic world, the issues facing leaders across multiple industries require insights on how to drive technological, cultural and ecosystem changes under unprecedented duress. The macro trends that are currently dominating the business world include the need for leaders to understand the best attributes of companies that have both digital and physical roots, as well as how to balance these macro issues in times of great uncertainty. Leaders need to make choices on where to deploy resources, those parts of the technical stack where they will seek to own technology (and where they will partner), and how they can influence, organize, and shape their ecosystems.",2,GSB Letter Graded,CAS,"Monday, Thursday",4:25:00 PM - 6:10:00 PM,,Robert Siegel; Jeff Immelt,No
STRAMGT507,From Invention to Innovation: The Process of Translation,,"The class intends to address specific challenges: 1) The challenges facing businesses are strongly rate-limited by the translation problems of new ideas, and inventions often do not make it into the market place or are disrupted at multiple levels in ways that are generally unpredictable; 2) The challenge of understanding how disruptive innovations take place in the context of the larger frame of translation. The concept of translation can be cast as the following equation, which will be discussed in the class: Innovation = (Inventiona+ C) &times; Translationb (Where a, b, and C are greater than zero) In light of these challenges, this class will address the following strategic questions and use it to propose a framework for innovation that will increase the probability of successful translation. The class will attempt to address the following questions and extract the principles for enabling translation. 1. What is Translation and why is it necessary? (Examples of Translation from the instructors and visiting lecturers) 2. What does it take for Translation that connects concepts to reality to succeed? 3. What factors prevent Translation from succeeding? 4.

STRAMGT514,Product/Market Fit,,"The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup's limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit.  In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information technology-based companies, but we have been told they may be more broadly applicable.  That being said, this course has been designed for someone who is truly interested in technology-based entrepreneurship.  Students who choose to take this course must be committed to read all the assigned articles and books to have the proper foundation to address the frequent counterintuitive learnings. In some cases that might require an entire (although relatively short) book be read for an individual class. A written assignment addressing at least one of the learnings from each reading will be required to be submitted at least four hours prior to each class. Failure to submit even one of the written assignments will result in a U. In addition to the daily written assignments, there will be a large individual project required at the end of the course. In other words, this course requires far more commitment than a typical GSB course, especially for one that offers only two credits.  However I promise this course will be invaluable should you choose an operating or investment career in the technology business.",2,GSB Letter Graded,SEM,"Monday, Thursday",4:25:00 PM - 6:10:00 PM,,John Vrionis,No

It is the largest and one of the fastest growing business opportunities US and worldwide.  Many business managers and entrepreneurs, however, do not consider the over 50 demographic in their plans, and those that do often do not understand how best to design products and services for this group.  It is a huge missed opportunity.  This class will explore how managers and entrepreneurs should consider the older population in their strategies, in product and service design, in managing their work force, and in their own careers.  Class topics will include: -The over age 50 opportunity and how it will grow over the coming years - The map of life and segmenting the older population - Considerations for developing products and services that are multi-generational and appealing to older consumers - New business opportunities created by the growth in the over 50 population, social trends, and technology - Managing older workers - Career considerations in a world where individuals live longer and healthier lives.

If you are interested in starting a company or gaining invaluable expertise for career advancement, RDI is a powerful approach. The RDI process was pioneered by Scott Brady, and its origin story is captured well in the ProjectSHED case. It is a curiosity-centric, structured approach to obtaining a complete picture of an industry or space through research and discussions with industry experts. Those who follow the RDI process stand on the shoulders of thought leaders, stakeholders, and experts to uncover patterns, identify gaps, and understand the big, impactful, non-obvious problems of an industry and the current and future opportunities surrounding them. Over the last few years, the framework has been formalized by Scott and Brett Jordan, and over 300 students have followed the process, resulting in numerous companies and impressive career opportunities. The output of this class would also be an excellent input for courses that focus on further fleshing out potential opportunities, such as Startup Garage.  Note: Teams generally have better experiences and outcomes with the RDI process than individuals, provided the groups form organically around shared topic interest and compatibility. While students cannot register as teams, we strongly encourage them to form teams before or in the early stages of the course. You are also welcome to collaborate with students outside the class.  We have created this RDI Interest Area List to help connect those with similar interests (link below).  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlOikI8OVtIhUPuYK3svTQxiUf1rxTJvtkuJbpD95gg/edit?gid=0#gid=0",2,GSB Pass/Fail,WKS,Tuesday,4:25:00 PM - 6:10:00 PM,,Scott Brady; Brett Jordan,No
STRAMGT549,Search Fund Garage,,"Search Fund Garage is an intensive, hands-on, project-based course for students planning to pursue a search fund directly after or within a few years of graduation. Students will learn from the instructors, course peers, and class visitors, particularly top current search entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors. This course is designed to assist students who are seriously pursuing a search fund. Those who have taken Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) or researched search funds extensively, including holding discussions with current searchers, investors, and CEO's, will benefit the most from this advanced, experiential course. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to or will already have raised search capital and launched their search, if they choose to do so. The course is not a good fit for students who do not know the basics of search funds (such as from taking S543) or are not likely to pursue a search fund upon or within a few years of graduation. Pursuing self-developed work plans that target the aspects of the search fund path most relevant to them at the time of the course, students will target industry segments and business models, evaluate investors, structure their search entity, set up their search process and outreach materials, perhaps begin to contact business owners, and develop wisdom about what makes a deal attractive or unattractive, among other experiences. Students will hear from class guests, including current searchers, standing CEO's of search-acquired companies, active investors, and former searchers (some of whom &quot;failed&quot; at buying a company) in order to inform their various decisions as they pursue a search fund. Each student will receive feedback on how they can be a more effective search fund entrepreneur. Teams of two are fine but not necessary. Most students join the class as individuals and all will be graded individually.This course is offered by the Graduate School of Business. It builds on the processes taught in Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) and detailed in the Stanford Primer on Search Funds (2020). The course provides a supportive yet challenging environment that will help students step outside of their comfort zone and accelerate learning. By the end of the course each will be better prepared to launch a search than many of the searchers who have come before.",2,GSB Letter Graded,WKS,Thursday,10:00:00 AM - 11:45:00 AM,,Peter Kelly; Gerald Risk,No

Managing the growth of enterprise software companies however is complex and requires a unique set of competencies across the interconnected functions in the organization.  This case-driven course will explore how enterprise software companies have managed growth at various stages of their evolution from startup phase to multibillion-dollar global companies.

This course will help you develop the skills and strategies necessary to effectively create and evaluate educational services and education technology startups, much like educators, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and venture capital investors do. Some questions we will discuss include: How do entrepreneurs, educators, and VCs evaluate and grow successful education and edtech startups? Why do most startups in edtech fail, and what are the critical ingredients for success, especially in today's challenging times? What does it take to get venture capital financing in edtech? Why now? Each week will feature a different entrepreneur as a guest speaker; these leaders hail from a variety of innovative for-profit and non-profit startups. As we hear from the speakers, we'll evaluate all aspects of their invention, particularly in the context of AI, distance learning and hybrid learning ecosystems. A fundamental question we'll explore in this course is how educators and technologists can better collaborate to leverage the scale and impact of technology to improve educational equity and access.

EDUC309X,Policy Practicum: Roses Talk: Elevating At-Promise Student Voices in San Jose Unified,,"Despite decades of efforts to remediate racial disparities in education, low-income schools serving predominantly students of color continue to face significant challenges that perpetuate unequal educational outcomes. While no single solution can solve these complex issues, insights from the most marginalized students offer an underutilized source of knowledge that can drive more effective policies and practices. This policy lab seeks to directly address persistent disparities in education by elevating at-promise student voices in school and district decision-making, reshaping our thinking around and approaches to advancing educational equity. With over 25,000 students, SJUSD is the largest school district in Santa Clara County, the county where Stanford University is located. District leaders and administrators at Gunderson High School-a Title I high school in South San Jose-have identified a collective need to better understand how to support &quot;at-promise&quot; students, those who may fail to earn a high school diploma for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to low scores on standardized tests, disengagement from school, English language learner status, previous suspension or expulsion, involvement in the foster care system, houselessness, and special education labeling. We recognize these young people as at-promise because it is the system that needs to shift in order to support and cultivate their tremendous, and often untapped, potential. This course rests on the assertions that education systems need to &quot;to see the wealth of knowledge and experiences these students bring to school&quot; (Rios et al., 2020). In this course, Stanford students will seek to answer this research question: How would at-promise students shape school and/or district policies and practices to improve their educational outcomes? Students will conduct focus groups with Gunderson at-promise students to develop policy recommendations that inform school and district decision-making, particularly around how to engage and improve outcomes for the most marginalized students in SJUSD. The course offers a unique opportunity for Stanford students to participate in community-engaged learning and research, apply technical skills and academic knowledge to real-world challenges, and contribute to positive educational outcomes for underserved students.

AA276,Principles of Safety-Critical Autonomy,,"Machine learning has led to tremendous progress in domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Fueled by these advances, machine-learning approaches are now being explored to develop intelligent physical systems that can operate reliably in unpredictable environments. These include not only robotic systems such as autonomous cars and drones but also large-scale transportation and energy systems. However, learning techniques widely used today are extremely data-hungry and lack the necessary mathematical framework to provide guarantees of correctness, causing safety concerns as data-driven physical systems are integrated into our society. This course covers the mathematical foundations of dynamical system safety analysis and modern algorithmic approaches for autonomous decision-making in safety-critical contexts. The focus is on designing safe controllers in the presence of system and environment uncertainty.

Architectural theory is primarily written, but it also incorporates drawing, photography, film, and other media.  One of the distinctive features of modern and contemporary architecture is its pronounced use of theory to articulate its aims. One might argue that modern architecture is modern because of its incorporation of theory. This course focuses on those early-modern, modern, and late-modern writings that have been and remain entangled with contemporary architectural thought and design practice.  Rather than examine the development of modern architectural theory chronologically, it is explored architectural through thematic topics.

CS186,How to Make a Moral Agent,,"Is it bad if you lie to ChatGPT? Who is to blame if ChatGPT lies? Should we let superhuman AI make life and death decisions? These questions ask whether advanced AI systems (today, often large language models&iquest;LLMs) can be moral agents&iquest;whether they are the kind of thing that can know how to make (ethically) correct decisions, and be held responsible for the rights or wrongs they do. Asking these questions leads us to questions about ourselves: What about us makes us moral agents? Is it our reason? Or is it essential that we emotionally feel each others' pain? Is selfishness irrational, or just unpleasant? Understanding ourselves can help us think about what kinds of artificial minds we would like to make, and, if we can, how. In this class, we provide the philosophical rigor and technical background necessary to robustly interrogate these and related questions. Readings will be drawn from philosophy, deep learning, and the cognitive sciences. The major assessment in this class will be a term project.

The course will: 1. Introduce students to the work of artists who used their practice to deeply engage social issues (Ian Rowland, Cornelia Parker, Fred Wilson and many others). These artists will be contextualized with readings including: critical commentaries on their work; theoretical literature; and primary literature on the issues they address (in these examples, slavery, material culture, museum studies). Critical questions will include: Why did the artist select particular media for their work? How does the art provide a different perspective on, engagement with, or relationship to the issues they address? How does the meaning of the art change with or without contextualization? How does this artist draw on and expand art history and other artists' work? Are there critical issues the work raises but is underpowered to address? 2. Provide support for students to work on their own quarter-length independent projects and research based in drawing, photography, creative writing, or other art practice which may shift according to research findings in the duration of the course. Part of the syllabus will be contingent on student projects. Regular group crit/support sessions will be held in class based on clear deadlines. 3.

This course will explore how virtually all the most consequential ideas emerging from now canonical thinkers - on human freedom and autonomy, reason, popular self-determination, property rights, civility, liberal toleration, equality, empirical social sciences and much else - arose as direct answers to the new epistemic, moral and political challenges of empire and colonial conquest. The world of empire indelibly shaped and created the intellectual legacy that informs modern social theory on a global scale - both its internal critiques, its liberal, and emancipatory potentials, as well as its many illiberal, racist and exclusionary strands and impulses. Each section has original texts, commentaries, and background readings that place these texts in their deeper historical setting. Many of these commentaries trace how practical theories of 'lower' or minor selves - the subject people of the colonies, slaves, and other - were integral to the very development of ideas of the modern, autonomous and reasonable self in the western world.

Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic: John Wayne. John Wayne's imposing corporeality and easy comportment combined to create an enduring, complex, icon of masculinity, of the American West, and of America itself. This seminar will concentrate on the films that contributed most strongly to the establishment of, maturation of, and even deconstruction of, the iconography and mythology of the &quot;John Wayne&quot; character. This concentration will also bring into view the western and war film as genres; the crisis of (and performance of) masculinity in postwar culture; gender and sexuality in American national identity; the relation between individualism, community, and the state; the Western and national memory; and patriotism and the Vietnam War. Most courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of John Wayne proposes that the body of films in which Wayne starred over 35 years demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials (especially when they went on, as Wayne did, to head their own production companies), but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom. Wayne's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the western and the war film (with the cavalry films neatly straddling both of these). Many of his best films were directed by two of the foremost directors in the American pantheon - John Ford and Howard Hawks: the chance to review their work with Wayne also serves as an occasion to explore the ways in which each differs from (and even comments upon) the other. Perhaps the most common criticism leveled against John Wayne as an actor was (and continues to be) that he was simply &quot;being John Wayne.&quot; This course proposes that first, this is no small thing, and second, it is also not really true.",3-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),DIS,, - ,,,No

The dialogues in question are not with ancient shades in the underworld but with later artists who build on the creative vision (and blind spots) of the past to addressthe issues of their day.Roman philhellenes, Renaissance humanists and Neoclassical loyalists have received much attention. More remains to be explored in the work of modern and contemporary artists such as Romare Bearden, Robert Mapplethorpe, Lawrence Argent, Daniel Arsham, Yinka Shonibare and Xu Zhen.In the Cantor Center and the Rodin Garden, the artist's debts to antiquity run deep; freed from his shadow, Camille Claudel's bronzes reflect the sunlit surfaces of Greek sculpture. On Meyer Green, the capital puns of Xu Zhen reverberate from Shanghai to Athens, from archetypes in the Louvre to galleries around the world, where classical &quot;icons&quot; - subverted, inverted and recharged - engage contemporary eyes. Classical tragedy spoke to war-weary Greeks in the 5th century. Today, Sophocles and Bryan Doerries' Theatre of War Productions help veterans to feel less alone as they return to civilian life bearing the wounds of war, visible and invisible. The vibrant and varied afterlife of Greek art is the subject of the seminar, but we will not ignore the sinister aspects of its legacy: the advertising industry's Botoxic embrace of &quot;Greek perfection,&quot; the quest for fitness at any price and the persistence of white, western, ableist ideals of male and female beauty.

During and following periods of colonial rule, how did the presence of African art transform the expressive possibilities imagined in modern painting, sculpture, and other media while also serving to challenge notions of Western cultural supremacy and exclusivity? Formal and discursive engagements with African art may be critically investigated as forms of &quot;primitivism,&quot; as scholars and curators have long argued.

This upsurge in filmmaking outside mainstream cinema was dubbed the &quot;Indian New Wave&quot; or &quot;parallel cinema.&quot; The goals of this graduate seminar include: Exploring the heterogeneous film cultures of the New Waves across multiple languages, categories of documentary and fiction, experimental and political cinema; Studying the relationship of the Indian New Waves to Third Cinema and other global art cinema traditions; Disrupting and expanding Eurocentric histories of art and political cinema; Examining the afterlives of the Indian New Waves through contemporary films and critical discourses on caste, gender, and sexuality; Cross-pollinating approaches that have traditionally been binarized across the art-popular cinema divide to foreground questions of dis/pleasure, cinephilia, stardom, labor networks, and the potential of gossip and anecdote as methodological approaches. For participants whose area of focus lies outside of South Asia, the seminar aims to discuss broader questions of cinema in relation to institutional networks in postcolonial contexts, state patronage and censorship, transnational influences and affiliations, infrastructures of canon formation, and new approaches to studying cinematic &quot;new waves.&quot;",5,Letter (ABCD/NP),LEC,Tuesday,1:30:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,McMurtry Art Building 370,Usha Iyer,No

ARTSTUDI247,Collage,WAY-CE,"Collage has profoundly shaped the evolution of painting, drawing, photography, and film through its embrace of juxtaposition, scale shifts, and the reappropriation of found imagery. Alongside assemblage and montage, collage emerged as one of the most generative principles of 20th-century art, introducing crucial aesthetic issues that continue to resonate in the modern and postmodern eras. While many iconic works in this medium date to the 20th century, this course positions collage as a dynamic, contemporary practice, interrogating both its historical roots and its ongoing relevance in the current cultural moment. Through lectures, we will explore the work of contemporary artists who have revitalized the medium, using collage to address complex themes of identity, politics, and the fragmented experience of modern life. We will examine the fundamental generative principles of collage - juxtaposition, displacement, materiality, difference, and event&iquest;and how these principles intersect with issues of location (where it happens), object (what it is), process (how it is realized), and purpose (why it is). The studio component will focus on hands-on experimentation, where students will develop a personal visual language through the manipulation of paper, found materials, and traditional and non-traditional techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the physicality of collage - its material properties and its capacity to create meaningful experiences through the act of making. This course encourages students to critically explore collage's potential for commentary on the political, aesthetic, and personal dimensions of contemporary existence.

ASNAMST11SI,"""Did You Eat Yet?"": Critical Food Studies in Asian America",,"What makes Asian cuisines Asian? What does it mean to define a group of people by the food they eat? Why is it that Asian Americans still face discrimination, despite the popularization of things like Chinese takeout, boba, and Pad Thai in the US? Food has been integral to Asian American culture and continues to have prominent influences on the American food landscape. From media depictions of Asian parental love through the phrase &quot;Did you eat yet?&quot; to racist remarks like &quot;Do you eat dog?&quot;, food follows Asian migrants wherever they go. This course focuses on the messy entanglements between food, empire, and Asian America. Food is a powerful sensory experience that can evoke the strongest of emotions and document the most traumatic of histories. However, for many Asian migrants, food is also how they access and form communities to make a new home for themselves. By looking at these connections, this course aims to explore how food racializes and is racialized in the US. The course will start by looking at how food can trace Asian American colonial entanglements and feed the US Empire. Then, we will look at how food has been used to racialize Asian Americans, diving into discourses of authenticity, labor, and smell. Finally, the course will end with discussions of how food functions as a form of community-building and resistance. We will use a wide range of media forms like academic journal articles, cookbooks, short-form videos, oral histories, and memoirs to explore these themes.",1-2,Satisfactory/No Credit,ACT,Wednesday,1:30:00 PM - 2:50:00 PM,,Thaomi Dinh,No

Since 1992 generations of Stanford students have heard, seen, and felt the power of taiko, big Japanese drums, at Admit Weekend, NSO, or Baccalaureate. Taiko is a relative newcomer to the American music scene. The contemporary ensemble drumming form, or kumidaiko, developed in Japan in the 1950s. The first North American taiko groups emerged from the Japanese American community shortly after and coincided with increased Asian American activism. In the intervening years, taiko has spread into communities in the UK, Europe, Australia, and South America. What drives the power of these drums? In this course, we explore the musical, cultural, historical, and political perspectives of taiko through readings and discussion, conversations with taiko artists, and learn the fundamentals of playing. With the taiko as our focal point, we find intersections of Japanese music, Japanese American history, and Asian American activism, and explore relations between performance, cultural expression, community, and identity.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,ISF,Monday,3:00:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,Braun 131,Linda Uyechi; Stephen Sano,No

Thinking transnationally, we will ground our thinking from the places and movements from across the Americas that these theories emerged from. Lastly, we will consider how feminisms from Black, Indigenous, Latinx, queer, trans, and global majority geographies are often grounded in liberatory struggles that are antipatriarchal, anticolonial and/or anticapitalist.",3-4,Letter or Credit/No Credit,SEM,Thursday,1:30:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,,M Ramirez,No

Cinema, as a popular form of entertainment, has represented identity in myriad ways. How have race, gender, class, and other intersecting markers of identity and marginalization been constructed on screen in Latin America and its diaspora? And how have these representations (frequently converging around the figures of outcasts, superheroes, and rebels) advocated for social justice, liberation, and belonging? These are the central questions that will guide the course's exploration of popular film within Latin American cultures as students develop a portable methodology to &quot;read&quot; and analyze moving images in different sociohistorical contexts.

Our inquiry is guided by the following questions: What qualities and experiences define someone as a hero? If heroism is not all about excellence, brilliance and glory, what makes heroes exceptional and inspiring figures? How does courage relate to other virtues such as integrity, loyalty, fortitude, and self-sacrifice? Is heroism compatible with fear, shame, and humiliation? How do heroes become what they are, what role do education and imitation play? Is courage a gendered virtue? Does the ethical importance of heroism rest on the fact that heroes are typically confronted with extraordinary choices about life and death, honor and ignominy, freedom and suffering, and survival and immortality? Finally, how do different cultures shape and enrich our answers to the above questions?",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),ISF,"Monday, Wednesday",12:30:00 PM - 1:20:00 PM,,Yiqun Zhou,No

CLASSICS21N,Did Women Travel? A Digital History,WAY-SI,"Gender and mobility have long been intertwined, from the confinement of women within the home in ancient Greek democratic Athens to the tailored guidelines for women traveling solo today. We will explore the question of women and travel with a focus on the eighteenth century, when tens of thousands of British travelers journeyed to Italy - voyages known then and since as the Grand Tour. These travels in the age of Enlightenment contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about education and leisure, all of which reverberate still today in our own models for tourism and educational travel, and for the genre of travel writing. The eighteenth-century Grand Tour has long been studied as the purview of young and male elites, traveling to become 'citizens of the world' before taking up their positions in society, inheriting family titles and entering marriages. Yet we know that women also traveled and a few even published their accounts, while the question of gender sex during visits to Italy was prominent. What can we learn about women traveling to Italy in the eighteenth-century and about contemporary ideas, and anxieties, about gender and sex in Italian journeys? We will use a variety of sources and methods. We will visit the Special Collections and the Rumsey Map Center in the Stanford Library to study rare historical books, manuscripts and maps, but also use digital tools for exploration and analysis of online collections and databases of textual and visual material. Part of our work will include experimentation with and contribution of credited research to an original dataset of hundreds of eighteenth-century women travelers to Italy that I have been creating.",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),ISF,, - ,,,No

This class will explore such a wide archaeological perspective in novels, poetry, fantasy literature, the arts, movies, online gaming, and through some key debates in contemporary archaeology about human origins, the spread of urban life, the rise and fall of ancient empires.",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),ISF,"Monday, Wednesday",11:30:00 AM - 12:50:00 PM,,Michael Shanks,Yes

More remains to be explored in the work of modern and contemporary artists such as Romare Bearden, Robert Mapplethorpe, Lawrence Argent, Daniel Arsham, Yinka Shonibare and Xu Zhen.In the Cantor Center and the Rodin Garden, the artist's debts to antiquity run deep; freed from his shadow, Camille Claudel's bronzes reflect the sunlit surfaces of Greek sculpture. On Meyer Green, the capital puns of Xu Zhen reverberate from Shanghai to Athens, from archetypes in the Louvre to galleries around the world, where classical &quot;icons&quot; - subverted, inverted and recharged - engage contemporary eyes. Classical tragedy spoke to war-weary Greeks in the 5th century. Today, Sophocles and Bryan Doerries' Theatre of War Productions help veterans to feel less alone as they return to civilian life bearing the wounds of war, visible and invisible. The vibrant and varied afterlife of Greek art is the subject of the seminar, but we will not ignore the sinister aspects of its legacy: the advertising industry's Botoxic embrace of &quot;Greek perfection,&quot; the quest for fitness at any price and the persistence of white, western, ableist ideals of male and female beauty.

Dismissing health and environmental harms as &quot;externalities,&quot; security experts have ignored this paradox and instead focused on the future of nuclear warfare. Yet for frontline communities --often Black or Indigenous in the US, and in formerly colonized territories elsewhere --nuclear activities pose a real, ongoing existential threat, not a hypothetical one. From nuclear testing in the Pacific and the deserts of Algeria, Kazakhstan, and the US, to uranium mines in Africa, Aboriginal Australia, and the Navajo Nation, the &quot;security&quot; promised by nuclear weapons involves sacrificing the lives and territories of (some) citizens, reinforcing racial, imperial, and colonial logics of disposability. This course will examine those patterns historically and ethnographically. It will explore how the pursuit of nuclear weapons joined people in otherwise disconnected parts of the world into a common history. For example, uranium extracted in apartheid South Africa was used in weapons tested in the Marshall Islands, dispossessing islanders from their homes; the ships used in these tests were later &quot;decontaminated&quot; in Bay Area naval shipyards, with deadly consequences for neighboring communities of color. It will also explore the differences in nuclear experience that resulted from pre-existing vulnerabilities distinct to each location.

We will examine themes of police brutality and racial vulnerability in Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight and Aleshea Harris's What to Send Up When it Goes Down. Through close readings of plays, we will explore the inter-articulation of intimacy and violence, intimidation and transgression, vengeance and forgiveness within the context of larger struggles for gender and racial justice. We will read plays in light of contemporary reckonings with the US criminal justice system: the #MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.

We will explore the degree to which West African cultural practices and sartorial choices are inherently underpinned by sustainability principles, especially among women.  The history of textiles in Africa also connects them to a transnational process dating from the pre-colonial and colonial periods from the 15th to the early 20th centuries, where Dutch, Danish, French and English merchants were responsible for introducing fabrics and styles from Indonesia, China, and India into the West African economy.  The course will focus especially on the history of African print cloths popularized by Vlisco, a Dutch company first established in 1848 whose products have dominated the high-end textile economy since then but which is also being challenged by impressive knock-off versions of their patterns from China.  African print cloth motifs have also appeared in the collections of some of the most upscale European fashion houses such as Dior, Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, and Stella McCartney, among various others. The course will also focus on questions of sustainability, centering especially on the secondhand clothes markets in Accra, Lome, and Lagos. The global fashion industry is second only to the oil industry in terms of environmental pollution, and it is the secondhand clothes industry that shows the effects of this pollution most dramatically.  We will follow the provenance of these clothes from Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, and China, how they are shipped to Accra and other places in West Africa, and the problems of waste disposal that they generate.  This will then be tied to larger questions relating to global fashion sustainability in the Global North, where the rhetoric of environmental awareness increasingly demanded by customers and clients often conceals the long-held practice of dumping unused clothes in various locations in the Global South.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,SEM,Monday,1:30:00 PM - 3:20:00 PM,,,No

Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic: John Wayne. John Wayne's imposing corporeality and easy comportment combined to create an enduring, complex, icon of masculinity, of the American West, and of America itself. This seminar will concentrate on the films that contributed most strongly to the establishment of, maturation of, and even deconstruction of, the iconography and mythology of the &quot;John Wayne&quot; character. This concentration will also bring into view the western and war film as genres; the crisis of (and performance of) masculinity in postwar culture; gender and sexuality in American national identity; the relation between individualism, community, and the state; the Western and national memory; and patriotism and the Vietnam War. Most courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of John Wayne proposes that the body of films in which Wayne starred over 35 years demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials (especially when they went on, as Wayne did, to head their own production companies), but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom. Wayne's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the western and the war film (with the cavalry films neatly straddling both of these). Many of his best films were directed by two of the foremost directors in the American pantheon - John Ford and Howard Hawks: the chance to review their work with Wayne also serves as an occasion to explore the ways in which each differs from (and even comments upon) the other. Perhaps the most common criticism leveled against John Wayne as an actor was (and continues to be) that he was simply &quot;being John Wayne.&quot; This course proposes that first, this is no small thing, and second, it is also not really true.",3-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),DIS,, - ,,,No

We will trace the transnational circulation of this text and its adaptations in Gambaro's Argentinian Antigona Furiosa, and Fugard and Kani's South African The Island.  We will read Shakespeare's Othello and consider questions of racism, misogyny, and intimate partner violence, investigate the reverberations of these themes in the OJ Simpson trial, and explore its afterlife in Toni Morrison's Desdemona. We will take up questions of sexual violence via John Patrick Shanley's Doubt and Ariel Dorfman's Chilean classic, Death and the Maiden. We will examine themes of police brutality and racial vulnerability in Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight and Aleshea Harris's What to Send Up When it Goes Down. Through close readings of plays, we will explore the inter-articulation of intimacy and violence, intimidation and transgression, vengeance and forgiveness within the context of larger struggles for gender and racial justice. We will read plays in light of contemporary reckonings with the US criminal justice system: the #MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.

ENGLISH5JA,"Women Without Men: Experiments in American Literature, 1890-1940",,"Spinsters, lesbians, workers, writers: women without men have been the object of sexual intrigue and social anxiety throughout the long history of American letters. In this course, we will think about women in American literature who are neither economically nor erotically dependent upon men, or else exhibit resistance to connections (sometimes economically or socially necessary) with men.  Focusing on works from the 1890s to 1940s by authors such as Sarah Orne Jewett, Willa Cather, and Nella Larson, we will ask: how have women writers imagined a social and economic life without men? Where, why, and how do the women in these narratives fail to achieve such a life (many of our narratives will end, tragically, in death or suicide)?  And what literary moves and experiments have such efforts to circumvent male-dominated worlds (including that of literature itself) engendered?  As we explore structures of both platonic and lesbian relationships between women,  our critical emphasis will be on feminist and queer theories, which students will further employ to analyze questions of class, economics, and narrative form. Students will come away with the ability to conduct independent literary research and produce scholarly writing.

ENGLISH5PA,Resisting English: Multilingualism in American Literature,WAY-A-II,"This course explores how 20th and 21st century Anglophone authors resist the rising dominance of English as the language of social, economic and cultural power by inserting multilingualism into English-dominant literature, either through direct translation, codeswitching, language creation, or other forms of linguistic interweaving. Course readings will include multilingual works by writers such as Juan Felipe Herrera, Xu Bing, Samuel Delany, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Ted Chiang, and will feature forms of linguistic expression ranging from indigenous pictographic writing to sci-fi alien languages. We will complement these readings with texts from the fields of translation theory and postcolonial studies, including selections from Gloria Anzald&uacute;a, Walter Benjamin, Amitav Ghosh, and Jacques Derrida. Student will learn how to read and write about this kind of theory, while also developing their skills in archival research through visits to the Library Special Collections. This course will be accessible to students regardless of linguistic background, and no additional foreign language skills are necessary. Instead, as we bring our speculative curiosity to texts containing languages we may not be able speak or read, we will confront - and upend - assumptions about the linguistic Other. We will also reflect on the different ways we use language in everyday life, and consider how we might translate that usage into our own writing.

ENGLISH5QA,"""Dressing Up"" in the Eighteenth Century",WAY-A-II,"In this course, we will delve into the multifaceted role of clothing as both a mask and a mirror, exploring the art of dressing up not only as a form of self-expression but also as a tool for social maneuvering in fiction and non-fiction of the long eighteenth century. How do garments transcend mere fabric to become a language of their own that individuals employ to negotiate status, desire, and agency? What compels someone to use disguise to assume an identity far removed from their own? How do changes to outward appearance spur internal transformations? From wealthy women disguised as sex workers and vice versa, to English Christians using clothing to assimilate with Turkish Muslims, to female husbands pursing wives and masculine careers after donning breeches, to twenty-first century Black women embodying the eighteenth century through dress, we will see how dressing up is at the heart of eighteenth-century interpretations of self and Other. Gaining a grounding in eighteenth-century literature more broadly as we read a variety of genres (including plays, poems, letters, memoirs and periodicals), we will uncover the secrets hidden beneath the seams and discover how dressing up has shaped&iquest;and continues to shape - our perceptions of self, relationships, and society.

Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic: John Wayne. John Wayne's imposing corporeality and easy comportment combined to create an enduring, complex, icon of masculinity, of the American West, and of America itself. This seminar will concentrate on the films that contributed most strongly to the establishment of, maturation of, and even deconstruction of, the iconography and mythology of the &quot;John Wayne&quot; character. This concentration will also bring into view the western and war film as genres; the crisis of (and performance of) masculinity in postwar culture; gender and sexuality in American national identity; the relation between individualism, community, and the state; the Western and national memory; and patriotism and the Vietnam War. Most courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of John Wayne proposes that the body of films in which Wayne starred over 35 years demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials (especially when they went on, as Wayne did, to head their own production companies), but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom. Wayne's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the western and the war film (with the cavalry films neatly straddling both of these). Many of his best films were directed by two of the foremost directors in the American pantheon - John Ford and Howard Hawks: the chance to review their work with Wayne also serves as an occasion to explore the ways in which each differs from (and even comments upon) the other. Perhaps the most common criticism leveled against John Wayne as an actor was (and continues to be) that he was simply &quot;being John Wayne.&quot; This course proposes that first, this is no small thing, and second, it is also not really true.",3-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),DIS,, - ,,,No

This course delves into the complex issues of sexual assault and harassment on college campuses, examining legal, policy, and political dimensions. We explore the prevalence of these issues, the historical and social contexts, and relevant laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. Through readings spanning social science, history, literature, law, health, and journalism, we analyze responses to campus violence, considering the intersectionality of race, class, gender, and other factors. Guest speakers, including experts and advocates, provide firsthand insights. Sensitive Material: The subject matter of this course is sensitive, and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. This course has no therapeutic component, although supportive campus resources are available for those who need them.

John Wayne's imposing corporeality and easy comportment combined to create an enduring, complex, icon of masculinity, of the American West, and of America itself. This seminar will concentrate on the films that contributed most strongly to the establishment of, maturation of, and even deconstruction of, the iconography and mythology of the &quot;John Wayne&quot; character. This concentration will also bring into view the western and war film as genres; the crisis of (and performance of) masculinity in postwar culture; gender and sexuality in American national identity; the relation between individualism, community, and the state; the Western and national memory; and patriotism and the Vietnam War. Most courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of John Wayne proposes that the body of films in which Wayne starred over 35 years demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials (especially when they went on, as Wayne did, to head their own production companies), but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom. Wayne's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the western and the war film (with the cavalry films neatly straddling both of these). Many of his best films were directed by two of the foremost directors in the American pantheon - John Ford and Howard Hawks: the chance to review their work with Wayne also serves as an occasion to explore the ways in which each differs from (and even comments upon) the other.

FRENCH101,The View From Paris,"WAY-A-II, WAY-EDP","The Global Gateway course explores the history of Paris through its artistic and literary production from the eighteenth century through the twentieth century. In this course, students will trace the cultural, artistic, political, infrastructural, and commercial changes over three centuries that made Paris, for a time, the capital of the modern world. Beginning with the Enlightenment, the course asks what aspects of Paris and its cultures of sociability were conducive to such knowledge production. Moving into the nineteenth century, students will examine how Paris became a main character in literature, as writers grappled with urbanization, industrialization, and the modernization of a city in transformation &iquest; whether by revolution, Haussmann's renovation of Paris, or commercial innovation with the birth of the department stores or &quot;grands magasins.&quot; Finally, the course concludes with a reflection on significant eras of artistic production in Paris, from the Belle &Eacute;poque to surrealism, World War II and the Occupation, Americans in Paris, postwar art and literature, and classic French cinema. In this course, students will engage with a rich variety of literary texts, secondary sources, and film. Students will also have the opportunity to work with materials in Special Collections from the Roxane Debuisson Collection on Paris History, including rare maps, commercial ephemera, photographs, postcards, billheads, and more. Readings may include texts by authors such as Mercier, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, George Sand, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Zola, Colette, Breton, Gertrude Stein, and Barthes.

In a country such as France - which espouses an assimilationist, as opposed to a &quot;melting pot&quot; ideology - one's national belonging is said to transcend their religious, racial, and ethnic particularities. As such, assimilating to a secular, universal model of Frenchness is considered key to the healthy functioning of society. Why might this be so, and has it always been the case? In this class, we will explore this and related questions as they have been articulated in France and the former French Empire from the Revolution through the twenty-first century. Via close study of literature, cinema, and still image, we will (a) examine how the universalist model deals with racial, religious, and ethnic differences, (b) assess how constructions of difference--be they racial, ethnic, or religious--change across time and space, and (c) assess the impact that the colorblind, assimilationist model has on the lived experiences of France's visible and invisible minorities.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,SEM,, - ,,,No

How do we interrogate this disturbing alliance between racial purity, environmental protection, and nation?

GLOBAL109,"Racial Justice in the Nuclear Age (CSRE 109, HISTORY 109)",,"In the 79 years since the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan, nuclear technologies have relied on and exacerbated conditions of insecurity and inequality. Dismissing health and environmental harms as &quot;externalities,&quot; security experts have ignored this paradox and instead focused on the future of nuclear warfare. Yet for frontline communities --often Black or Indigenous in the US, and in formerly colonized territories elsewhere --nuclear activities pose a real, ongoing existential threat, not a hypothetical one. From nuclear testing in the Pacific and the deserts of Algeria, Kazakhstan, and the US, to uranium mines in Africa, Aboriginal Australia, and the Navajo Nation, the &quot;security&quot; promised by nuclear weapons involves sacrificing the lives and territories of (some) citizens, reinforcing racial, imperial, and colonial logics of disposability. This course will examine those patterns historically and ethnographically. It will explore how the pursuit of nuclear weapons joined people in otherwise disconnected parts of the world into a common history. For example, uranium extracted in apartheid South Africa was used in weapons tested in the Marshall Islands, dispossessing islanders from their homes; the ships used in these tests were later &quot;decontaminated&quot; in Bay Area naval shipyards, with deadly consequences for neighboring communities of color.

HISTORY109,"Racial Justice in the Nuclear Age (CSRE 109, GLOBAL 109)",,"In the 79 years since the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan, nuclear technologies have relied on and exacerbated conditions of insecurity and inequality. Dismissing health and environmental harms as &quot;externalities,&quot; security experts have ignored this paradox and instead focused on the future of nuclear warfare. Yet for frontline communities --often Black or Indigenous in the US, and in formerly colonized territories elsewhere --nuclear activities pose a real, ongoing existential threat, not a hypothetical one. From nuclear testing in the Pacific and the deserts of Algeria, Kazakhstan, and the US, to uranium mines in Africa, Aboriginal Australia, and the Navajo Nation, the &quot;security&quot; promised by nuclear weapons involves sacrificing the lives and territories of (some) citizens, reinforcing racial, imperial, and colonial logics of disposability. This course will examine those patterns historically and ethnographically. It will explore how the pursuit of nuclear weapons joined people in otherwise disconnected parts of the world into a common history. For example, uranium extracted in apartheid South Africa was used in weapons tested in the Marshall Islands, dispossessing islanders from their homes; the ships used in these tests were later &quot;decontaminated&quot; in Bay Area naval shipyards, with deadly consequences for neighboring communities of color.

Coastal communities in the U.S. and beyond are already in the process of planning relocation to escape erosion, rising sea levels, and other slow-onset effects of climate change. Displacement has significant economic, social, psychological, and cultural costs. Yet persistent knowledge gaps on these costs and how to mitigate them impede the efforts of leaders, advocates, and policymakers who face climate displacement challenges today.

ILAC301,The Contemporary Latin American Novel: Pacified vs Combative Fiction,,"This graduate course, taught in Spanish, surveys the Latin American novel post the Bolano-in-translation phenomenon and sets up the scaffolding for its theorization. Our point of departure is the late critic Pascale Casanova's antinomy of pacified vs combative literatures. The former sees literature as business-as-usual, copyrighted highbrow entertainment. The latter as a site for struggles of political and literary recognition. Does the latest wave of Latin American literary internationalization - brokered by agents, awards and social media - lead to a pacification of the literary field? Topics include overproduction; Netflixization; autofiction; brain drain; so-called boom femenino; boomerang effects; mainstreaming of genre fiction; translation lag; self-publishing; single-use fiction; and degrowth. We combine breadth (overview) and depth (analysis of a few works). Critical readings by Campisi, Schiffrin, Walkowitz, English, Anibal Gonz&aacute;lez and others, with sociologies of literature as a cum grano salis touchstone. Weekly reading pace: one work of fiction or excerpts, plus two articles. Primary author selection and Zoom guest speakers from across the region, with an emphasis on Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and (expats in) Spain.

Today, great power competition is back - or so it seems - with many describing our present era as a &quot;New Cold War&quot; between the United States and China and Russia. What happened? Is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy? What should the U.S. do to meet the challengers of great power competition in the 21st century? This course seeks to answer these questions about contemporary great power relations, first by tracing the historical origins of the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships, next by assessing the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-Russia relations and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions -- (1) Power, (2) Ideology, (3) Interdependence and Multilateralism - and third by discussing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy prescriptions of US. policymakers.

This course surveys current and emerging legal, policy and governance challenges related to artificial intelligence. The course will explore regulatory initiatives and proposals from around the world, such as the European AI Act and U.S. Executive Orders, while also examining how existing laws related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property, civil rights, and national security apply to this developing technology. The course will also cover the AI policy debates related to balancing innovation and safety in a variety of contexts, from autonomous vehicles and weapons, to social media and elections. Cross-cutting themes will include: how law and policy affect the way important societal decisions are justified; the balance of power and responsibility between humans and machines in different settings; the incorporation of multiple values into AI decision-making frameworks; the interplay of norms and formal law; technical complexities that may arise as society scales deployment of AI systems; AI's implications for transnational law and governance and geopolitics; and similarities and differences to other domains of human activity raising regulatory trade-offs and affected by technological change.

INTLPOL350,International Law,,"(LAW 5013) This course provides a general introduction to international law and its role in today's complex and interdependent world. We will begin by considering foundational questions about the nature of international law, such as: the origins of international law in the sovereign equality of states; the global governance challenges arising from the absence of assured mechanisms for the interpretation or enforcement of international law; the sources of international law (including treaties and customary international law); the subjects of international law; principles of state responsibility; and the bases upon which states may exercise jurisdiction. We will then examine the incorporation and operation of international law in the U.S. legal system. In the second half of the course, we will look at a series of contemporary international law topics and issues, including international dispute resolution, international human rights law, the law governing coercion and the use of armed force, the law of armed conflict, international environmental law, and international criminal law. Throughout, we will consider current issues and problems arising in the international arena, as well as whether and to what extent international law affects the behavior of states.

INTLPOL358,"Business, Social Responsibility, and Human Rights",,"(LAW 1047) Large corporations now routinely spend millions of dollars to protect human rights and the environment. Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront: --What does it mean for a company to &quot;do good&quot;? Should it care? --When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns? --What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives? We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground. Special Instructions: Students have the option to write a long research paper in lieu of the final exam with consent of instructor.

In a country such as France - which espouses an assimilationist, as opposed to a &quot;melting pot&quot; ideology - one's national belonging is said to transcend their religious, racial, and ethnic particularities. As such, assimilating to a secular, universal model of Frenchness is considered key to the healthy functioning of society. Why might this be so, and has it always been the case? In this class, we will explore this and related questions as they have been articulated in France and the former French Empire from the Revolution through the twenty-first century. Via close study of literature, cinema, and still image, we will (a) examine how the universalist model deals with racial, religious, and ethnic differences, (b) assess how constructions of difference--be they racial, ethnic, or religious--change across time and space, and (c) assess the impact that the colorblind, assimilationist model has on the lived experiences of France's visible and invisible minorities.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,SEM,"Monday, Wednesday",1:30:00 PM - 2:50:00 PM,,Rebecca Glasberg,No

MLA364,A Short History of Security,,"This course interrogates what people mean when they talk about security. Security justifies inconveniences like passwords that are nearly impossible to memorize, and metal detectors to enter sporting events, political talks, and airports. Security is said to be central to processes leading to war: the pursuit of security by one state may imperil the security of another, leading to a spiral of conflict that international relations scholars call &quot;the security dilemma.&quot; Sometimes we are asked to ignore impolite, nasty, or thoughtless behavior because someone suffers from the absence of security. Yet despite its importance and centrality in social and political life, security suffers from vagueness and imprecision. It can connote freedom from fear, or freedom from threat. Security's modifiers are abundant and suggest a wealth of objects to be secured; a non-exhaustive list includes human, social, national, international, nuclear, cyber, food, economic, energy, and homeland.  In this course we will investigate how the meanings of security have shifted throughout history. We will ask why security becomes a societal preoccupation at different times in history.

MCS120,Data Narratives (DATASCI 120),,"The class allows students to grow their ability to communicate ideas and insights with data. There are many components of a well-crafted narrative based on data---from a discussion of data sources to visualization, and from pattern detection to generalizable conclusions---which we explore in sequence across the quarter. The class does not introduce advanced data analysis techniques. It rather focuses on the essential elements of an inquiry conducted with data and places a special emphasis on how to record and communicate these. Each student enrolled in class needs to identify a dataset and a question that they are going to explore. As we examine the different components of a data inquiry, the students will carry out a corresponding analysis/writing assignment on the data they have identified, gradually building material for the narrative that will constitute their final paper.

MATH21,Calculus,"GER:DB-Math, WAY-FR","This course addresses a variety of topics centered around the theme of &quot;calculus with infinite processes&quot;, largely the content of BC-level AP Calculus that isn't in the AB-level syllabus. It is needed throughout probability and statistics at all levels, as well as to understand approximation procedures that arise in all quantitative fields (including economics and computer graphics). After an initial review of limit rules, the course goes on to discuss sequences of numbers and of functions, as well as limits &quot;at infinity&quot; for each (needed for any sensible discussion of long-term behavior of a numerical process, such as: iterative procedures and complexity in computer science, dynamic models throughout economics, and repeated trials with data in any field).  Integration is discussed for rational functions (a loose end from Math 20) and especially (improper) integrals for unbounded functions and &quot;to infinity&quot;: this shows up in contexts as diverse as escape velocity for a rocket, the present value of a perpetual yield asset, and important calculations in probability (including the famous &quot;bell curve&quot; and to understand why many statistical tests work as they do).  The course then turns to infinite series (how to &quot;sum&quot; an infinite collection of numbers), some useful convergence and divergence rests for these, and the associated killer app: power series and their properties, as well as Taylor approximations, all of which provide the framework that underlies virtually all mathematical models used in any quantitative field.

MATH51,"Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Modern Applications","GER:DB-Math, WAY-FR","This course provides unified coverage of linear algebra and multivariable differential calculus, and the free course e-text connects the material to many fields. Linear algebra in large dimensions underlies the scientific, data-driven, and computational tasks of the 21st century. The linear algebra portion includes orthogonality, linear independence, matrix algebra, and eigenvalues with applications such as least squares, linear regression, and Markov chains (relevant to population dynamics, molecular chemistry, and PageRank); the singular value decomposition (essential in image compression, topic modeling, and data-intensive work in many fields) is introduced in the final chapter of the e-text. The multivariable calculus portion includes unconstrained optimization via gradients and Hessians (used for energy minimization), constrained optimization (via Lagrange multipliers, crucial in economics), gradient descent and the multivariable Chain Rule (which underlie many machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation), and Newton's method (an ingredient in GPS and robotics). The course emphasizes computations alongside an intuitive understanding of key ideas. The widespread use of computers makes it important for users of math to understand concepts: novel users of quantitative tools in the future will be those who understand ideas and how they fit with examples and applications. This is the only course at Stanford whose syllabus includes nearly all the math background for CS 229, which is why CS 229 and CS 230 specifically recommend it (or other courses resting on it).

MATH77Q,Probability and gambling,WAY-FR,"One of the earliest probabilistic discussions was in 1654 between two French mathematicians, Pascal and Fermat, on the following question: 'If a pair of six-sided dice is thrown 24 times, should you bet even money on the occurrence of at least one `double six'?' Shortly after the discussion, Huygens, a Dutch scientist, published De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (The Value of all Chances in Games of Fortune) in 1657; this is considered to be the first treatise on probability. Due to the inherent appeal of games of chance, probability theory soon became popular, and the subject underwent rapid development in the 18th century with contributions from mathematical giants, such as Bernoulli, de Moivre, and Laplace. There are two fairly different lines of thought associated with applications of probability: the solution of betting/gambling and the analysis of statistical data related to quantitative subjects such as mortality tables and insurance rates. In this Introsem, we will discuss poker and other games of chance, such as daily fantasy sports, from the perspective of risk analysis. This Introsem does not require any programming knowledge, but some experience with Excel, MATLAB, R, and/or Python will enhance your experience in our discussion of daily fantasy sports.

MUSIC31N,Behind the Big Drums: Exploring Taiko (ASNAMST 31N),"WAY-A-II, WAY-EDP","Preference to Freshman. Since 1992 generations of Stanford students have heard, seen, and felt the power of taiko, big Japanese drums, at Admit Weekend, NSO, or Baccalaureate. Taiko is a relative newcomer to the American music scene. The contemporary ensemble drumming form, or kumidaiko, developed in Japan in the 1950s. The first North American taiko groups emerged from the Japanese American community shortly after and coincided with increased Asian American activism. In the intervening years, taiko has spread into communities in the UK, Europe, Australia, and South America. What drives the power of these drums? In this course, we explore the musical, cultural, historical, and political perspectives of taiko through readings and discussion, conversations with taiko artists, and learn the fundamentals of playing. With the taiko as our focal point, we find intersections of Japanese music, Japanese American history, and Asian American activism, and explore relations between performance, cultural expression, community, and identity.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,ISF,Monday,3:00:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,Braun 131,Linda Uyechi; Stephen Sano,No

Are they, as Bernard Suits suggests, the only intrinsically valuable pursuit?  Or are they merely ways to temporarily escape a harsher reality?  Are they training exercises for success in real life?  And if they don't matter, why are we so drawn to them?  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 15-24-year-olds spend an average of 90 mins/day playing video games.  That's a lot of time! We want to give this important class of human activities the philosophical attention it deserves.  We'll examine some central questions in the philosophy of games such as:  Why play games? What even is a game?  Is there anything that all games have in common? Wittgenstein famously claimed that this is a question with no good answer - we'll see if we can do better! In addition, we'll look at some broader philosophical issues that can be illuminated by thinking about games. These include: What makes something valuable?  What are the origins of communication?

Is suicide ever a reasonable choice? Can death be bad for the dead person, given that they no longer exist, and are not here to suffer?  Do the wishes that dead people had when they were alive matter? Should the expectation of death structure how I live?

Given this shortage, should a person be allowed to sell one of her kidneys? Should a prisoner be allowed to trade one in exchange for a reduced sentence? While many people are comfortable with the idea of altruistic surrogacy, commercial surrogacy is far more controversial. Should a woman be allowed to sell her services as a surrogate? Is there a morally significant difference between gestational surrogacy and genetic surrogacy? What is disability? To what extent is it medical matter, and to what extent is it a matter of oppression or social exclusion? What can we do, morally speaking, for the sake of preventing suicide? When (if ever) are coercive interventions like involuntary commitment and forced drugging morally appropriate? What (if anything) do we owe to non-human animals? What (if anything) do we owe to human fetuses and embryos? What kinds of entities are entitled to moral consideration and why? Some people say that a woman should be allowed to make reproductive decisions on whatever grounds she chooses, including prenatal testing for conditions like Down syndrome; others condemn selective abortion as an unacceptable form of eugenics. What genetic information (if any) should be allowed to influence choices about whether to terminate a pregnancy? When the Supreme Court decided that abortion was a constitutional right in Roe v.

If you'd like to enroll in the course please send an email to Prof. Joseph Torigian at jptori@stanford.edu with your name, grade, and a brief paragraph as to why you want to enroll.Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis described China and Russia as &quot;revisionist powers,&quot; signaling that, after years of focus on the Middle East and terrorism, great power politics once again sit at the center of U.S. foreign policy. But how have the political elite in these two countries thought about their security in the broadest sense? This course explores how leaders in Beijing and Moscow have historically sought to defend themselves against other competitors from within the regime, their own people, and other great powers. Drawing on international relations and comparative politics, the course applies political science theories to better understand how powerful actors in China and Russia behaved similarly or differently during crucial historical moments.During this course, students will learn the promises and pitfalls of comparing two countries with strong similarities but also significant differences. Why did the two major revolutions of the twentieth century occur in China and Russia? How did Mao Zedong and Josef Stalin translate violence, cult of personality, and strategic maneuvering into political power? Why was it that they also presided over major famines? Why did China and Russia see such different outcomes to reforms in the 1980s? What kind of authoritarianism do they impose on their population today? How have Beijing and Russia dealt with their ethnic and religious minorities? Why do they diverge with regards to nuclear weapons postures?  How do these countries turn ideology and religion into political instruments? What is the role of individual leaders?

Structured in two parts, in the first half of the quarter we will situate the study of gender and politics within the broader study of identity politics and set out to understand the different political implications of gender at the intersection of other identities (like race, class, sexual orientation, religion, and partisanship). In the second half of the quarter, we will cover a range of key substantive topics in gender politics from both institutional and behavioral angles, including gender in relation to the state, electoral politics, representation, stereotyping and discrimination, and political mobilization. We will dig into questions like: how do we define and measure identity - particularly gender and sex - in the study of public opinion? How do gender gaps in political attitudes and behavior vary across racial groups and class status? Does sharing a common gender identity influence the relationship between Democratic and Republican women? What is the role of race, gender, and factors like having a traditional household profile in the evaluation of candidates and how do these factors influence decisions to run for office or other forms of political engagement? Does the incorporation of women into legislatures influence state welfare policy? Throughout the course, we will read and discuss scholarly work from a range of academic disciplines and be exposed to and evaluate a variety of empirical research designs and methods to answer these questions and more.

POLISCI231R,The Politics of Nature,,"Long before the idea of nature comes to be associated with the vocabularies of environmentalism and climate change, the study of nature as a real and imaginary category has informed human self-understanding, molding the ways in which political ideals and institutions are designed and construed. While nature nurtures humans along with other beings, the numerous mysteries that it poses - some still unresolved - continue to destabilize politics' promise of orderliness and set limits to the emancipatory potential of social arrangements of various kinds. The endeavor to tame nature's whim and parse its inner logic - be it through science or art - proclaims to liberate us from the disillusionment with our own state of powerlessness without ever settling the tension between humans and their surroundings. The looming threat of the climate crisis and the global pandemic further reminds us of the persistent challenges brought to politics by our embeddedness in the physical world. How does the idea of nature, along with the various methods deployed to examine it, give rise to key concepts in our political thinking, including law, state, and property? What aspirations can various accounts of nature bring to politics in terms of what the latter can hope to achieve with regard to freedom, equality, and happiness? How are human beings supposed to arrange their own societies vis-&agrave;-vis their neighbors - human and nonhuman - with whom they share the earthly realm?

POLISCI235M,Cold War Political Theory: From the Center to the Peripheries,,"Analysts, pundits, and politicians have repeatedly warned us about entering a &quot;New Cold War&quot; between the United States and China. The reference to the Cold War intends to invoke the historical imagination of a binary world where liberal free world defends itself against the expansion of communist dictatorship through economic, political, and military measures. This imagination, however, reflects only a limited vision articulated by thinkers and policymakers at the &quot;center&quot; of the so-called liberal world - France, the United States, the United Kingdom, etc. It eclipses the continuing struggle between the center and peripheries over the meaning of political values, the vision of global order, and the vehicles of social change. This course walks us back to these contestations by closely reading important intellectual texts produced during the Cold War. By closing examining ideas, theories, and visions articulated in these texts from both the center and the peripheries, we seek to reconstruct the variegated faces of the Cold War, disrupt our current image of the Cold War, and reconsider the ways in which we imagine the future of our world.",5,Letter or Credit/No Credit,SEM,Monday,9:30:00 AM - 12:20:00 PM,,Simon Luo,Yes

The introduction includes study of Marx's classic critique of liberal democracy because the understanding of conservativism also requires an appreciation of the leading alternative. The seminar then turns to developments in the immediate aftermath of World War II, when a self-consciously conservative movement in the United States first emerged as a national force and concludes with an examination of the leading debates among conservatives today. The seminar meets once a week. It revolves around careful reading of assigned texts, robust discussion of the materials, and analysis from a variety of perspectives.

POLISCI249R,The Political Economy of Tax Evasion,,"Taxation is a phenomenon as old as the state itself. So is tax evasion. Throughout its history, noncompliance with the fiscal burden imposed by the government has taken many forms and meanings. In most cases, evasion is a crime and a policy issue. In some, it is also a consequential political act, from the Boston Tea Party initiating the American Revolution to the Poll Tax Riots marking the end of the Thatcher era in 1990 UK. In all instances, noncompliance concerns the heart of the social contract between citizens and the state, underpinning the functioning of most modern societies. This course adopts a comparative and international political economy approach to tax noncompliance and enforcement. In the first part, we will explore the issue of tax evasion from a fundamental economic and policy perspective. Why do taxpayers decide to shirk? How do tax authorities curtail noncompliance? In the second part, we will analyze the political dimension of tax evasion. What are the political causes and consequences of tax fraud? Under what conditions do governments increase enforcement?

Today, great power competition is back - or so it seems - with many describing our present era as a &quot;New Cold War&quot; between the United States and China and Russia. What happened? Is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy? What should the U.S. do to meet the challengers of great power competition in the 21st century? This course seeks to answer these questions about contemporary great power relations, first by tracing the historical origins of the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships, next by assessing the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-Russia relations and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions -- (1) Power, (2) Ideology, (3) Interdependence and Multilateralism - and third by discussing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy prescriptions of US. policymakers.

POLISCI351C,Institutions and Bridge-Building in Political Economy,,"This course critically surveys empirical applications of formal models of collective-choice institutions.  It is explicitly grounded in philosophy of science (e.g., Popperian positivism and Kuhn's notions of paradigms and normal science).  Initial sessions address the meanings and roles of the concept of institutions in social-science research.  Historically important works of political science and/or economics are then considered within a framework called Components of Institutional Analysis (or CIA), which provides a fully general way of evaluating research that is jointly empirical and formal theoretical.  The course concludes with contemporary instances of such bridge-building. The over-arching objectives are to elevate the explicitness and salience of desirable properties of research and to illustrate the inescapable tradeoffs among the stipulated criteria.  Although this is a core course in the GSB Political Economy PhD curriculum, its substantive foci may differ across years depending on the instructor.

How do we foster broadly beneficial political reforms and good governance when the potential losers to reforms are able to mobilise to prevent them?  How do we detect and mitigate the effects of corruption? What role may modern finance play in creating or mitigating political economy challenges in developing countries?These problems are modern and endemic, but many are also old problems, and economic theory and the practical experiences of different countries have much to tell us both about what has worked in the past, and what policy experiments we may try in new environments. Rather than a survey, the objective of this course is to selectively discuss new and open research areas in political development economics and the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to contribute to them, with the topics chosen to complement other Stanford courses in applied microeconomics, development, political economics and economic history. By the end of the course, the student will have analysed a theoretical or historical solution to a key political development challenge and proposed a natural or field experiment to test it empirically.

PSYCH131A,How to Think Like a Shrink (PSYC 230),,"This course will teach you how to think (or experience) yourself and the communities around you as a therapist does. That means coming to understand why therapists focus on early life relationships and learning, why we privilege emotions, and why we see the seeming contradictions in our lives as places for deeper understanding. In class discussions, we will consider questions such as: How do our early experiences in relationships affect the ones we create later?  Why are we more likely to segregate and point fingers when we are afraid? How can we make better use of our precious capacity for attention? What good might come from anger, sadness or guilt? Projects will include looking at how the psychological phenomena we will learn about play out in public spheres and personal ones. This is not a class about mental health, but rather about the intricacy of our feeling and thinking minds. The course will be discussion-based with a focus on experiential learning, and include weekly projects that will have you playing detective in your own life.  Prerequisites include a high degree of honesty (or the desire for this), creativity and an interest in the human experience. The course may include a field trip to a sensory deprivation float tank as we study attention. At the end of the seminar, I hope you will have a greater appreciation for the complexity of your mind and reactions, and the psychology of everyday life -- personal relationships, group functioning, tiffs between political parties. My aim is to have you learn to both take yourself very seriously and not seriously at all.

Though most commonly identified with one particular literary genre, devotional lyric poetry written in north Indian vernaculars, and one particular religion, Hinduism, bhakti comes in many guises. We will examine bhakti as part of a phenomenology of authentic and personal religious experience but also as an emblem of legitimacy that empowers specific communities and values at the expense of others. We will explore the vital role that bhakti has played in Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim and even South Asian Christian religious imaginations.  We will look at how bhakti is inscribed within Indian history, in the context of ephemeral performance, as well as within colonial and contemporary South Asian politics and political theology. As the course unfolds, we will trace the multi-dimensional impact of devotional religion within literate and non-literate media, through languages and regions, among different castes, classes, traditions, even across and beyond the category of religion itself.

Is the Cold War label an illuminating or distorting analogy? What should the U.S. do to meet the challengers of great power competition in the 21st century? This course seeks to answer these questions about contemporary great power relations, first by tracing the historical origins of the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships, next by assessing the similarities and differences between the Cold War and U.S.-Russia relations and U.S.-China relations today along three dimensions -- (1) Power, (2) Ideology, (3) Interdependence and Multilateralism - and third by discussing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral policy prescriptions of US. policymakers.

How does agency develop out of and within socio-technical systems? What does agency mean and where do we have agency?

Through close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing, we will engage in the critical discussions of class struggle, individual interest versus collective values, race, and social equality, and identify points of convergence and divergence between the two systems. To what extent was the opposition between capitalism and socialism fueled by the artistic vision of the great Russian and American writers? What was these thinkers' ideal of society and what impact did it have on shaping emerging socialism? Readings for the class include the fundamental works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Jack London, W.E.B. Du Bois and Sholem Aleichem.

ILAC301,The Contemporary Latin American Novel: Pacified vs Combative Fiction,,"This graduate course, taught in Spanish, surveys the Latin American novel post the Bolano-in-translation phenomenon and sets up the scaffolding for its theorization. Our point of departure is the late critic Pascale Casanova's antinomy of pacified vs combative literatures. The former sees literature as business-as-usual, copyrighted highbrow entertainment. The latter as a site for struggles of political and literary recognition. Does the latest wave of Latin American literary internationalization - brokered by agents, awards and social media - lead to a pacification of the literary field? Topics include overproduction; Netflixization; autofiction; brain drain; so-called boom femenino; boomerang effects; mainstreaming of genre fiction; translation lag; self-publishing; single-use fiction; and degrowth. We combine breadth (overview) and depth (analysis of a few works). Critical readings by Campisi, Schiffrin, Walkowitz, English, Anibal Gonz&aacute;lez and others, with sociologies of literature as a cum grano salis touchstone.

TAPS101F,"Close Cinematic Analysis: Being John Wayne (ARTHIST 199, ASNAMST 108, FEMGEN 104, FILMEDIA 101, FILMEDIA 301)","GER:DB-Hum, WAY-A-II","This course engages in close analysis of different cinematic themes, genres, and artists. Specific topics may vary by term/year/instructor. This term's topic: John Wayne. John Wayne's imposing corporeality and easy comportment combined to create an enduring, complex, icon of masculinity, of the American West, and of America itself. This seminar will concentrate on the films that contributed most strongly to the establishment of, maturation of, and even deconstruction of, the iconography and mythology of the &quot;John Wayne&quot; character. This concentration will also bring into view the western and war film as genres; the crisis of (and performance of) masculinity in postwar culture; gender and sexuality in American national identity; the relation between individualism, community, and the state; the Western and national memory; and patriotism and the Vietnam War. Most courses on film are built around directors, genres, nations, or periods. A course on the films of John Wayne proposes that the body of films in which Wayne starred over 35 years demonstrate not only a coherence and consistency, but also a variety, that merits closer examination. Stars frequently exerted control over their materials (especially when they went on, as Wayne did, to head their own production companies), but this an aspect of filmmaking that has received little attention in the classroom. Wayne's work in this period occurs primarily in two genres: the western and the war film (with the cavalry films neatly straddling both of these). Many of his best films were directed by two of the foremost directors in the American pantheon - John Ford and Howard Hawks: the chance to review their work with Wayne also serves as an occasion to explore the ways in which each differs from (and even comments upon) the other. Perhaps the most common criticism leveled against John Wayne as an actor was (and continues to be) that he was simply &quot;being John Wayne.&quot; This course proposes that first, this is no small thing, and second, it is also not really true.",3-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),DIS,, - ,,,No

Students work as a team to propose a single consensus solution to a real-world design challenge. This collaborative studio experience more closely reflects the creative process in the design and planning professions where a group of individuals works together to brainstorm, shape, develop, and illustrate a community design solution. There are a number of benefits to this team-oriented approach: it is a more nurturing environment for students that do not have design backgrounds, it allows for more peer-to-peer learning, and it takes best advantage of varied student skill sets. But perhaps the greatest benefit is that a team of students working together on a common project will be able to develop a more comprehensive solution than any one student working alone. This means that the class &quot;deliverable&quot; at the end of quarter could be detailed enough to be of significant value to a stakeholder or client group from the larger community.

LAW809W,Policy Practicum: Thinking in Systems,,"Virtually every public policy has causes and consequences beyond those that are intended or immediately visible. This is true of criminal law policies that use algorithmic predictions of flight before trial; environmental policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and conventional pollutants; and social and health policies that address homelessness, institutional racism, and the distribution of Covid vaccines, to name just a few examples. The causes of the problems that these policies seek to address are complex. As a result, these policies often fail and sometimes have unintended adverse consequences.  &quot;Systems thinking&quot; reveals the web of associations in which such policies reside. Its goal is to identify the multiple causes of problems and aid in designing enduring solutions. Thinking in systems and learning to map systems are core skills for policy makers.

LAW809X,Policy Practicum: Roses Talk: Elevating At-Promise Student Voices in San Jose Unified,,"Despite decades of efforts to remediate racial disparities in education, low-income schools serving predominantly students of color continue to face significant challenges that perpetuate unequal educational outcomes. While no single solution can solve these complex issues, insights from the most marginalized students offer an underutilized source of knowledge that can drive more effective policies and practices. This policy lab seeks to directly address persistent disparities in education by elevating at-promise student voices in school and district decision making, reshaping our thinking around and approaches to advancing educational equity.  With over 25,000 students, SJUSD is the largest school district in Santa Clara County, the county where Stanford University is located. District leaders and administrators at Gunderson--a Title I high school in South San Jose--have identified a collective need to better understand how to support &quot;at-promise&quot; students (a positive reframing of &quot;at-risk&quot; that is reflected in California education law), those who may fail to earn a high school diploma for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to low scores on standardized tests, disengagement from school, English language learner status, previous suspension or expulsion, involvement in the foster care system, houselessness, and special education. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated challenges for these students, with metrics of achievement and well-being worsening each year since 2020.  Coined by Tupac Shakur and applied to education by Dr. Jeff Duncan-Andrade, the &quot;rose that grew from concrete&quot; is a metaphor for young people who often experience the most challenging environments but nonetheless show unmatched resilience and determination to overcome their circumstances. If these &quot;roses&quot; are given opportunities to talk, what would they tell us about what they need from school to succeed? Reaching this student demographic is critical for several reasons. Being the most marginalized, improving their outcomes can often improve outcomes for all students, school quality, and a district's overall health. These students also bring unique perspectives on schooling because they have benefited the least from it, which may challenge ignorance and certainty around what approaches and programs are most effective in working with them. Most importantly, at-promise students have an exceptionally high potential to make a difference in the world--an ideal that is at the core of the U.S. education system. Our society has a responsibility to help them reach that potential.  In this course, Stanford students will conduct focus groups with Gunderson at-promise students to develop policy recommendations that inform school and district decision making--particularly around how to engage and improve outcomes for the most marginalized students in SJUSD. The course offers a unique opportunity for Stanford students to participate in community-engaged learning and research, apply technical skills and academic knowledge to real-world challenges, and contribute to positive educational outcomes for underserved students. It embodies the principle that higher education institutions can and should play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of K-12 public education for all students.  TIMELINE AND EXPECTATIONS: The practicum will be completed in two phases. Phase 1, Winter Quarter: Stanford students will be introduced to basic qualitative research methods, relevant literature, best practices, and impactful laws and policies. They will work collaboratively to develop an interview protocol to use for 1-2 focus groups with Gunderson students. Following data collection, students will engage in qualitative analysis and draft preliminary findings to present to SJUSD and Gunderson leaders for oral and written feedback. Phase 2, Spring Quarter: Based on preliminary findings and feedback, students will formulate interview questions and facilitate a final focus group with Gunderson students to clarify and/or confirm preliminary findings. Students will finalize and draw on their findings to conduct policy research and analysis, legal research and analysis (as needed), and develop evidence-based policy recommendations for the school and school district. Their work will culminate in a final report and presentation to Stanford, SJUSD, and Gunderson leaders in late spring. Please note that this timeline is subject to change. LOGISTICS: Ideally, practicum students would commit to participating in winter and spring quarters. However, students who are only able to participate for winter quarter will also be considered. The winter quarter lab is standard 3-units, while spring quarter lab will be variable 2-3 units to accommodate continuing students. Session meeting times and travel arrangements to/from San Jose will be determined once a final group of practicum students are selected.  ENROLLMENT AND GRADING: This class is open to Stanford Law School students, and available for cross-registration for undergraduate and graduate students from across campus. We highly encourage students from outside the Law School to apply, particularly students from the Graduate School of Education. Ideal students will have strong research, writing, and analytical skills, oral communications skills, and a demonstrated commitment to improving educational outcomes for all students. Students will be working together in small teams. Grading will be based on attendance, class performance and participation, collaboration with peers, engagement with high school students, written assignments, and presentations.  COURSE OBJECTIVES: (1) Increase at-promise student engagement by amplifying their voices in school and district decision making; (2) equip Stanford students with essential qualitative, policy, and legal research skills and apply these skills in collecting and analyzing data to identify challenges and opportunities for at-promise students; (3) collaborate with peers and instructors to develop evidence-based policy recommendations for improving at-promise student engagement and outcomes, culminating in a final report that influences policies and practices at Gunderson and in SJUSD; and (4) promote diverse perspectives and ideologies by challenging existing beliefs about at-promise students and their communities, encouraging open-mindedness, and fostering thought-provoking conversations about contentious issues that appreciate a wide range of viewpoints.  CONSENT APPLICATION AND ADDITIONAL MATERIALS: To apply for this course, students must submit a Consent Application Form at SLS Registrar https://registrar.law.stanford.edu/.  Additionally, students must submit a resume and writing sample via email to Dionna Rangel at drangel@law.stanford.edu.

LAW902A,Community Law Clinic: Clinical Practice,,"Located off-campus at a site accessible to low-income members of the communities adjacent to Stanford, the Community Law Clinic is the closest thing to a traditional legal services office within the Mills Legal Clinic. CLC is fundamentally a trial practice clinic, practicing in three distinct, but intertwined subject areas: (1) housing, (2) social security disability and public benefits, and (3) post-conviction relief. In addition to its off-campus location, hallmarks of the CLC practice include extensive client contact, civil litigation skills (motion practice, oral advocacy, fact investigation), and the fast pace that comes from being responsible for several matters at once. Each student represents clients in all three practice areas, allowing for a diverse experience with clients, opponents, and other system-actors. Students may also participate in larger policy and legislative efforts in the relevant subject matters. CLC work emphasizes students' embodying the role of a lawyer (as opposed to a policymaker, judge, or intern) and the development of communication, collaboration, time management, cultural humility and other skills necessary for any professional setting. After intensive training in weeks 1 and 2, the clinic curriculum includes two group seminar sessions per week and a once/week student-led case rounds session. CLC's off-campus location affords students the chance to explore local neighborhoods and the opportunity to form a close-knit and collaborative learning environment.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website.

Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions.  Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system.  Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career.  The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

LAW910C,Immigrants' Rights Clinic: Clinical Coursework,,"The Immigrants' Rights Clinic offers students the opportunity to represent immigrants before the San Francisco Immigration Court, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Asylum Office, federal district courts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Students in the clinic are responsible for all aspects of litigation, including interviewing clients and witnesses, investigating facts, conducting legal research, writing motions and briefs, and developing case strategies. Students argue motions and conduct mini-trials trials in which they perform direct examination of clients and witnesses and any cross-examination of government witnesses.  The Clinic represents asylum seekers, immigrant survivors of domestic violence and other forms of violence, individuals with past criminal convictions, and undocumented individuals with longstanding ties to the United States. All clinic students also have an opportunity to work in collaboration with local and national immigrants&iquest; rights groups on impact litigation and/or other advocacy projects designed to address federal government immigration enforcement practices at the national and local levels, including impact litigation to challenge prolonged immigration detention, local and state advocacy to limit enforcement activity by police, the creation of model pleadings and know your rights materials for immigrant detainees, and advocacy with the federal agencies that regulate immigration. No prior substantive experience or background in immigration or immigrants' rights work is necessary.  Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor.

LAW912A,International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic: Clinical Practice,,"This Clinic trains law students to be critical and creative human rights lawyers, effect social change, and serves as a lab for the human rights and conflict resolution fields. Students work with civil society on a range of human rights advocacy projects and participate in a seminar where they learn a broad array of skills from the human rights and conflict resolution fields, including project selection, design, and strategy; choice and sequence of advocacy tactics; fact-finding methodologies and evidence assessment; interdisciplinary research methods; trauma-informed interviewing; digital and physical security; writing advocacy documents; using judicial and quasi-judicial processes; advocating to the UN, government, and media; navigating ethical dilemmas; facilitating workshops; undertaking conflict analysis; designing and facilitating dialogues; fundraising; and engaging in project evaluation. Throughout the quarter students are required to complete assignments for the seminar and participate in Clinic project rounds where students discuss their work on projects with their peers and supervisors. The core of students' time in Clinic is spent on project work focused on urgent and under-addressed issues in close partnership with advocates and impacted communities. The Clinic's practice spans three areas: peace and justice, equality and non-discrimination, and rights across borders. Clinic students work on project teams, supported by the close oversight from Clinic supervisors. Students extensively engage directly with partners and may travel, if such travel is required to conduct the work. The Clinic also serves as a lab for innovative advocacy strategies and provides a space for practitioners to connect across geographies and disciplines and reflect on and test innovative and critically-responsive advocacy strategies through joint projects. Projects may therefore involve multiple partners in the United States and around the world. The Clinic aims to create a space where all students are able to bring their full selves and participate in all aspects of the Clinic.

Students in the clinic may be called upon to collaborate with technologists, researchers, doctors, economists, social scientists, industry experts, and others to develop and articulate the appropriate advocacy for their clients. The bi-weekly clinic seminar focuses on student-led workshops regarding client projects, and on engaging with current thinking around race, technology, and the legal system; innovation and innovation economics; and the impact of IP, antitrust, and other law and regulation on innovation. Students will critically examine the role of lawyers advocating for the public interest, for racial justice and reforms to the legal system, and for sound and sensible innovation policy outcomes. A background in technology may be useful in some cases but is not necessary to a successful experience in the clinic.--Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Elements used in grading: Attendance, preparation for and participation in clinic seminar; reflection papers; and clinical case and project work including specific elements of methodical analysis, critical thinking, close reading, efficient writing, effective collaboration, and strategy development, applicable across client and seminar work.",4,Law Honors/Pass/Restrd Cr/Fail,CLN,, - ,,Nina Srejovic; Phillip Malone,No

LAW918A,Religious Liberty Clinic: Practice,,"The Religious Liberty Clinic is the leading clinic of its kind in the country. The landmark program offers participating students a full-time, first-chair experience representing a diverse group of clients in legal disputes arising from a wide range of beliefs, practices, and circumstances. Students learn in class and engage through reflective and supervised practice the laws, norms, and limits affecting the exercise of religious freedom in a pluralistic society. Students are expected to counsel individual or institutional clients and litigate on their behalf with excellence, professionalism, and maturity. In clinic, students typically handle an accommodation project - e.g., represent a prisoner, student, or employee facing obstacles in the exercise of faith - as well as a longer-term litigation or development matter - e.g., represent a small church, synagogue, or mosque with zoning issues, or an individual challenging state preferences for particular beliefs. Opportunities to draft amicus briefs also arise.

The bulk of the clinic will be run as a small law firm working on live cases before the Court. Students will participate in drafting petitions for certiorari and oppositions, merits briefs, and amicus briefs, compiling joint appendices, and preparing advocates for oral argument, as well as commenting (the technical term is &quot;kibbitzing&quot;) on drafts of briefs being filed by lawyers in other cases. The precise nature of the cases will depend on the Court's docket, but in recent Terms, the clinic's cases have involved federal criminal law and procedure, habeas corpus, constitutional and statutory antidiscrimination and employment law, bankruptcy law, and the First Amendment. Our aim is to involve students as fully as possible in this type of litigation.  The Clinic begins with an intensive introduction to the distinctive nature of Supreme Court practice, including the key differences between merits arguments and the certiorari process, the role of amicus briefs, and the Supreme Court Rules. After that, seminar meetings will be devoted primarily to collaborative work on the cases the clinic is handling. While students will be primarily responsible for working in teams on one case at a time, they will also be expected to acquire familiarity with the issues raised in other students' cases and will both edit each others' substantive work and assist each other and the instructors with the technical production work attendant on filing briefs with the Supreme Court.

LAW922A,Youth and Education Law Project: Clinical Practice,,"The Youth and Education Advocacy Clinic offers students the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of educational rights and reform work, including direct representation of youth and families in special education and school discipline matters, community outreach and education, school reform litigation, and/or strategic policy research and consulting. All students will have an opportunity to represent elementary and high school students with disabilities in special education proceedings, to represent students in school discipline proceedings, or to work with coalitions and/or other education-sector agencies to advance equity-minded educational policies and school reform. Students working on special education matters will have the opportunity to handle all aspects of their clients' cases. Students working in this area will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, work with medical and mental health professionals and experts, conduct legal and educational research, create case plans, and represent clients at individual education program (IEP) team meetings, mediation or special education due process hearings. This work will offer students a chance to study the relationship between individual special education advocacy and system-wide reform efforts such as impact litigation. Students working on school discipline matters will interview and counsel clients, investigate and develop facts, interview witnesses, conduct legal and educational research, create case plan, and represent clients at school discipline hearings such as expulsion hearings. Such hearings provide the opportunity to present oral and written argument, examine witnesses, and present evidence before a hearing officer. If appropriate and necessary, such proceedings also present the opportunity to represent students on appeal before the school district board of trustees or the county board of education. Students may also have the opportunity to participate in complex school reform litigation, including the monitoring and enforcement of a consent decree and corrective action plan in an ongoing special education lawsuit or appellate and trial work in a pathbreaking educational rights case on behalf of Native American students. Finally, students who are interested in strategic policy research and management consulting on behalf of public education institutional clients (school districts, charter schools, state education agencies) will have the opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary collaborations with non-profit clients. The education clinic includes a one-week intensive training program held at the beginning of the quarter, weekly seminars that focus on legal skills and issues in law and education policy, regular case review, and a many opportunities for feedback and reflection with the instructors. Admission is by consent of instructor. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses -- The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. -- Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. -- Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours.

Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. -- The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond &quot;normal business hours.&quot; Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic).

LAW1047,"Business, Social Responsibility, and Human Rights",,"Large corporations now routinely spend millions of dollars to protect human rights and the environment. Shell Nigeria builds hospitals and schools in the Niger Delta. Nike employs hundreds of inspectors to improve conditions for the factory workers who produce its shoes across Asia and Latin America. Technology companies such as Facebook have scrambled to fend off the threat of new regulation since the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Other examples abound, across industries and around the globe. &quot;Don't be evil&quot; (Google's former motto) may be one motivation for these companies, but something more mundane is also at work: many companies believe they will do well, financially, if they do good, ethically. This course examines questions that lawyers in large law firms, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies regularly confront: --How does business activity affect human rights and other &quot;social&quot; goods (such as the environment and community cohesion)?  --What factors, internal and external to companies, shape corporate decisions that have human rights/social impacts? When does it serve a company's interest to take costly action to address human rights, labor, and environmental concerns? -- What tactics have activists used to shift public opinion, media frames, and the law, and thereby change companies' incentives? We will learn through seminar-style discussion, lectures, role play, and small group exercises. Several guest speakers with experience in business, advocacy, or in between will provide insights from their experiences on the ground.

LAW1079,Introduction to Transactional Practice,,"This course will provide an introduction to corporate and transactional work. It's targeted to 1Ls and 2Ls but open to all, whether you're exploring different areas, intending to go corporate, curious about a non-litigation practice, or just broadening your exposure to legal work. The course is practical in nature. It will help you prepare for job interviews and summer jobs, give you practical exposure to materials and terminology encountered in practice, and help you make more informed choices about course selection. Along the way we'll identify characteristics of corporate work generally, to give you a big picture take on the work; look at major practice areas (e.g., capital markets, corporate governance, public companies, M&amp;A, credit, commercial); identify features or realities of work in those areas; walk through and try to demystify contracts, governance materials, deal management tools, and other legal and financial documents; explore pro bono and how corporate lawyers can contribute to the community; talk about client service and core practice skills; and suggest some ways to get your hands around and do everyday lawyer work. And we'll try to offer a perspective on professional identity different than that of the litigation-oriented first year. Class preparation includes review of associate training videos used by major law firms, short readings from a visuals-heavy book designed as an introduction to corporate practice, and weekly written assignments, all but one of which are pretty brief in nature. The classes largely involve instructor presentation but have plenty of opportunities for discussion. The course is neither a prerequisite nor a substitute for core business law classes such as Corporations or Securities Regulation. It's also not a substitute for experiential and skills courses such as clinic or Advanced Legal Writing: Business Transactions; for business-oriented classes such as Accounting or the finance classes; or for programming provided by the Office of Career Services. But it should provide good context for those courses and programs.

For the client work, students will perform client intake, draft an initial scope of work, complete due diligence and make supplemental due diligence requests, make any necessary adjustments to scope of work, and ultimately deliver work product in the format most appropriate &amp; valuable for the particular matter (typically drafted contracts related to formation, fundraising, and stakeholder involvement).

LAW1088,Law and Governance in ESG Strategy,,"ESG has gone through a maturation process, marked by scrutiny on the left and pressure on the right, with the result that companies are refocusing their efforts on ESG topics that are relevant to the business and ESG measures that are right-sized for their organizations.  As companies revisit and redesign their ESG roadmaps through this new lens, legal, regulatory and governance drivers are playing a more significant role than ever before, and lawyers, both in-house attorneys and outside counsel, are being called on to oversee strategic ESG initiatives, serve as internal ESG champions, and chair management-level steering committees composed of representatives from across the enterprise.  These regulatory drivers also interact in complicated and nuanced ways with voluntary standards, which despite concerted efforts towards convergence, still differ in meaningful ways.  Meanwhile, commercial ESG requirements from customers or other business partners, flowed down in supplier policies and incorporated into contracts, have emerged as an extremely influential ESG driver, and for smaller companies, can often determine the contours and content of an ESG program.  These developments have combined to create significant challenges for companies from an internal oversight and management perspective, as they wrestle with how to effectively advance strategic ESG objectives against the backdrop of an ever-growing patchwork of laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations.  This course will explore the role of law, regulation and governance in shaping ESG strategy and the methods used by companies to manage this complexity, including with respect to climate-related matters, product sustainability claims, diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights, responsible sourcing, and sustainability and AI.

This fundamentally transforms the job of lawyers engaged in international business and other forms of exchange.  This seminar will explore the process of globalization, de-globalization and its consequences, particularly for U.S. transactional lawyers. US relations with China will serve as the most important bilateral manifestation of the trend and its legal, financial, and geopolitical implications although the course will touch upon other regions as well.  The format will comprise weekly lectures and discussions with readings and short writing assignments or group projects.  The first third of the seminar will explore the broader phenomenon of deglobalization and its general implications, including such topics as due diligence, financial and commercial law and its enforcement, and ownership of raw data; the second, the tools available to address specific problems such as legal uncertainty and risk mitigation; and the third, case studies showing how those tools are effectively, or ineffectively, applied in the real world.  The seminar will conclude with exercises designed to give students the opportunity to identify problems and devise remedial strategies.  The specific problems will stem from topics that appear in the news, which will demonstrate the immediate relevance of what the course covers.

LAW2008,Criminal Justice Reform & Litigation: Three Strikes Project,,"Criminal Justice Reform &amp; Litigation: Three Strikes Project (2008): This seminar is an opportunity to study mass incarceration and criminal law reform in real time while getting hands-on experience in active litigation on behalf of Three Strikes Project clients serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes. In this course, students read and analyze a variety of cases and articles, examining the evolution of incarceration and sentencing policies.  Students also assist with live post-conviction litigation on behalf of clients in trial and appellate courts across the country. The class focuses largely on the Three Strikes law as a case study in the history, politics, constitutional doctrine, and reform of criminal law policy. Thanks to assistance from students, over 250 of our clients have been freed from life sentences, and students been intimately involved in criminal policy reform movement through Project partnerships with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and the Obama White House. Seminar students quickly become involved in all aspects of the Project's work, including assistance with cases in different stages of ongoing litigation. Students will visit a Project client in prison, conduct factual investigations, and draft court pleadings. The Project is an active, fast-paced program that depends on the hard work and contributions of law students enrolled in this seminar. This seminar offers the opportunity to both study the theory behind the law and hone practical litigation and advocacy skills. The seminar will meet for 3 hours per week, including 1-hour small group meetings with Project director Michael Romano.

LAW2525,Public Lands,,"The federal government owns and manages 28% of all land in the United States, and 48% in California, the third-highest percentage in the nation. How the federal government manages public lands therefore has profound implications for countless constituencies and users, affecting everything from recreation to conservation to more intensive uses such as mining, timber production, and cattle grazing. This seminar will explore the history, operation, power, and limits of America's federal public-land laws. We will focus on four specific types of public lands: national forests, BLM lands, national parks, and wildlife refuges. We will learn about the laws that govern each type of public land and use modern-day controversies to examine how those laws work in practice and whether (and how) they need changing. We will also devote attention to the historic and present-day exclusion of (and injustices toward) Indigenous peoples and tribes in our public-lands system and opportunities for repair and inclusion moving forward. Readings and discussion, which together will form the backbone of this small seminar, will range from case law to policy papers to pleadings in litigated cases, and throughout the seminar students will complete short assignments tied to the subjects they cover. This course complements, but does not cover, the material in Natural Resources Law and Policy (Law 2506) or Federal Indian Law (Law 7030).

But there often isn't enough attention devoted in law school either to thinking creatively or to reflecting in a creative way on the issues students confront inside and outside the classroom. This course will respond to this gap by building a bridge between law and the arts, with the goal of helping students hone their ability to think creatively and use disciplined imagination. Law &amp; Creativity will meet twice a week and have dual components designed to inform one another. The first session will be structured as a seminar in which students gather to examine and discuss creative treatments of legal and professional issues in a variety of media (including film, fiction, and nonfiction).

This seminar will explore the concept of the &quot;unreasonable person,&quot; those who do not fulfill the threshold of legal accountability, and its implications. We will discuss the developments of doctrines, such as insanity, incapacity, minority, and senility, that attempt to define those who fall short of full legal accountability. We will also examine how the law has grappled with the activities of &quot;unreasonable people.&quot;  We will also consider legal fictions, such as the reasonable person standard, which attempts to clarify those who qualify for full legal accountability and how they have shifted historically.

Rather than then going through section 1 of the amendment clause by clause (citizenship, privileges and immunities, due process, and equal protection) and then skipping to section 5 and Congressional power--we will briefly discuss the seldom mentioned sections 2 and 3, but don't worry, we won't spend a minute on the public debt provisions of section 4!--the course will then explore the amendment's doctrinal evolution with respect to several broad areas of American life, ranging from education to democracy to the economy to criminal justice to intimate relationships (not necessarily in that order). Obviously, we can't cover every area that the amendment touches. But the idea is to give you the tools to work with the changing doctrine and to be an intelligent critic of where we started and where we are. Class format will be a combination of lecture, on-call panels, and open discussion. Grading will be based on an exam and class participation.

LAW7016,Critical Race Theory,,"Developed in the 1970s and 1980s, and for decades relevant only to law professors and activists, Critical Race Theory has recently become an object of criticism and controversy far beyond the legal academy. Some of the tenets of Critical Race Theory have made their way into other fields, including sociology, education, and cultural studies. Jurisdictions throughout the United States have passed laws banning the teaching of Critical Race Theory.  This class will examine the questions that are at the heart of current CRT controversies: What is critical race theory? Where did it come from? How does it illuminate and help counter the racism that has long plagued American society? Just as critical race theory constitutes a critique of American law and institutions, so too will the course take a critical perspective toward CRT, identifying both virtues and vices of the CRT project. The analysis of CRT, in turn, raises broad questions about  the role of race and racism in American society and its intersection with law reform efforts.  The readings will be varied. They will include law review articles and judicial opinions, and also articles drawn from the popular media.  Special Instructions: Grades will be based on attendance, class participation and (1) a short research paper or (2) a long research paper with consent of the instructor.

LAW7021,Family Law,,"This course will explore how the law regulates intimate relationships among adults and parent-child relationships. These laws, a mix of constitutional and statutory, state and federal, touch all of our lives, when we marry or divorce, or decide not marry an intimate partner, when we become parents, or decide not to become parents. Family Law provides the legal context, the background rules, pertaining to what are unquestionably the most important decisions in our lives-- the choice of a life partner, and whether to become a parent. In probing this body of law, we will also explore big questions about how the government should regulate people with respect to their intimate lives. Our first question: If marriage did not exist as a legal institution, would there be any good reason to create it as one?  Readings will be drawn from the professor's recently published (and revised) Casebook, a digital copy of which will be provided free of charge.

LAW7040,Social Justice Impact Litigation and Lawyering,,"This seminar explores doctrinal, strategic, and ethical issues related to social justice lawyering and impact litigation in today's legal environment.  The course will draw on the instructor's decades of experience litigating immigration and civil rights law reform and class action cases in federal courts nationwide as founder and director of the ACLU Immigrants Rights' Project and on service in the Obama and Biden administrations at DHS and DOJ. The course will explore strategies for advancing the constitutional and civil rights of vulnerable communities in a range of areas that may include policing and criminal justice reform, immigrant justice, LGBTQ+ equality, labor rights, and other social justice issues. We will discuss such topics as bringing test cases, identifying plaintiffs; conducting coalition litigation; strategic pleading; the role of amicus briefs; suits for damages versus injunctive relief; standing and mootness; ethical problems; attorneys' fees; using the media; and the role of government and agency lawyers. Specific issues will be informed by student interest.  The emphasis will be on suits against the federal government but litigation against states and localities (as well as private entities) will also be discussed. Guests with a range of views and with expertise in different areas will be invited. Enrollment is limited and the seminar is not open to 1L students. Students are expected to submit a series of reflections (totaling 18 pages) in response to seminar issues and guest speakers.

LAW7041,Statutory Interpretation,,"Statutory law is the dominant source of contemporary law, and it is the form of law that lawyers are likely to confront most often in almost any area of practice. It is also an area of vibrant intellectual debate, as scholars, Supreme Court justices, and others debate the methods and aims of statutory interpretation. This course will stress both the practical and theoretical dimensions of interpretation. Students will learn and apply the methods of statutory interpretation. We will also spend considerable time on contemporary controversies, such as debates about textualist, purposive and dynamic interpretation; about the use of legislative history and canons of construction; about the special interpretive problems that arise in the context of direct democracy; and about the democratic and constitutional foundations of statutory interpretation itself.

Focus will be on concepts and litigation strategy rather than doctrine. Topics will include injunctive relief (including nationwide injunctions); the interaction between litigation and the legislative/rulemaking process; who can (and who should) sue on public policy questions; how to navigate the fuzzy dividing line between lawyer and policymaker when representing elected officials; and the overall role of the courts in addressing public policy challenges.

LAW7139,Resisting Contemporary Authoritarianism?,,"Over the last two decades, the world has witnessed an insidious rise in authoritarianism, characterized by populist leaders being voted into power in countries purporting to be constitutional democracies.  This seminar, taught principally from the perspective of lawyers/practitioners, will examine the relationship between law and authoritarianism with a view to assessing the efficacy of legal tools (litigation, legal advocacy and documentation/public education) deployed in domestic and international fora for resisting authoritarian practices. The seminar will examine (i) what we mean by authoritarianism and democratic decline; (ii) whether, why, and when we should be concerned about authoritarianism and democratic decline; (iii) global trends with respect to democratic decline; (iv) why and how authoritarianism might have waxed or waned in countries which could be described as &quot;democracies,&quot; including, for example, in Brazil, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Mexico, Poland, Senegal, and the United States; (v) the relationship between authoritarian tactics deployed in particular countries and international human rights norms such as those concerning electoral integrity, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, and judicial and prosecutorial independence and accountability; and (vi) the role of the courts and jurisprudence concerning these tactics. In addition, the course will engage students in identifying, as a practical matter, what works and what does not work in resisting contemporary authoritarianism.

LAW7807,Facilitation for Attorneys,,"Most lawyers and other professionals spend a significant amount of time in meetings and working in teams or groups for a variety of purposes, and many report that this can be a frustrating experience. As the practice of law becomes more complex, it includes more and more situations where groups of people need to work together planning complex legal strategies, developing firm policies, working with corporations or other multi-person clients, or participating in shareholder meetings, public commissions and councils, corporate and non-profit board of directors meetings. Group functionality and outcomes can be significantly improved by any group member who has the awareness and skills of a facilitator, whether or not that person is formally designated as the facilitator. The interactive class methodology will combine discussion with many exercises and roleplays, putting facilitation tools into practice every step of the way. We will examine group dynamics and learn skills used by professional facilitators to prevent common problems and elicit the best work of a group. We will explore how to prepare effectively with clear goals, collaborative problem definition, inclusive process design and a well-structured agenda. We will also discuss and practice core meeting management skills such as how to balance voice and participation, build consensus, inspire creativity and promote principled evaluation and decision-making. Finally, we will identify and apply communication skills that keep group sessions productive, and tools to manage difficult moments and problem behaviors. Class Schedule dates: In Winter, this class will meet Friday, Jan 10: 4-9pm, Sunday, Jan 12: 9a-6p, and Saturday, Jan 18: 9a-5p.

LAW7809B,Advanced Legal Research:  Litigation,,"This course aims to prepare law students for research in litigation practice and judicial clerkships. More broadly, the primary goal is to enable students, now and later in their professional lives, to map out a coherent plan of action when asked to research a topic previously unfamiliar to them.  Students should acquire a solid knowledge of research tools and a frame of reference that enables them to function independently and competently in the complex world of legal information.  Students will accomplish the following learning objectives: (1) demonstrate, analyze, and execute common research strategies and processes related to legal research, and habitually assess your research strategies and processes as you research; (2) develop an understanding of and approach to researching common litigation research questions; and (3) find, evaluate, and use legal research materials, including different types of secondary sources and primary sources, to answer general and specific research questions. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises, homework assignments, and a final research hypothetical -- all of which contribute to grading. There will not be a final exam.

The course provides a wide range of realistic drafting and research exercises to help students sharpen their analysis, research, drafting, and editing skills, and develop sensitivity to the expectations of attorneys and clients with whom they will be working. Students will learn to interpret provisions in a variety of business agreements. Issues related to ethics in a transactional practice will also be addressed. The course should appeal especially to students interested in working for a law firm and practicing transactional law (be it corporate, venture, debt, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, entertainment, real estate, etc.).

LAW7819,Mediation,,"As law is practiced today, attorneys are generally far more likely to participate in more mediations than trials. Mediation offers parties a consensual, confidential, and facilitated process through which agreement can be reached at any stage of the dispute. This course offers an initial immersion into the fundamentals of mediation and mediation advocacy.  The course goals are to understand the nature of conflict and principles of conflict management; to develop the oral and written communication skills essential to effective mediation; to evaluate various mediation models and mediator styles; to practice all phases of mediation and the appropriate use of caucusing; to consider policy and ethical implications; to explore dispute design considerations and the deeper dimensions of conflict resolution; and to develop the skills necessary to mediate and represent clients in mediation.  The class methodology is highly experiential, with more than half of the class consisting of practice from the perspective of mediator, advocate, and client.

LAW7821,Negotiation,,"As a lawyer, you will probably negotiate more than you do anything else. You will negotiate not just over cases, but any time that you need something that you cannot get alone. You will negotiate with your boss, your clients, your paralegal, and all of their counterparts (plus the lawyers) on the other side. You will negotiate with &quot;the system&quot; whether it is the court, the government, the structure of society, or the law. You will also continue to negotiate with your family, your friends, and yourself. This course is designed to: (1) develop your understanding of negotiation, and your awareness of yourself as a negotiator; (2) give you some tools and concepts for analyzing and preparing for negotiations; (3) enhance your negotiating skills through frequent role plays, reflection, and feedback; and (4) teach you how to keep learning from your own negotiation experience. In addition to negotiation skills and theory (including interviewing, counseling, negotiation, fact analysis, legal analysis, and collaboration), you will be introduced to issues of representation, ethics, and the place of negotiation in our legal system. The Negotiation Seminar is an intense, interactive course. We will require weekly preparation of readings, simulations, and written assignments. Basically, you will learn by reading about specific research and doing simulated negotiations -- figuring out with the rest of the class what works and what does not, writing about what you're learning, and trying again. Because participation in the simulations is central to the course, attendance at all classes is required. Since we will begin our simulation exercises on the first day of class, all students who are interested in taking the course (whether enrolled or on the wait-list) need to be present for the first class. (Students who are not present will be dropped from the class or waiting list unless they have made previous arrangements with the instructor.)

LAW7824,Advanced Negotiation: Public Policy,,"Advanced Negotiation courses are designed to take students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar, to examine many facets of negotiation complexity, both in terms of the participants and topics. This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems, specifically when there are divided communities. We will study negotiations and stakeholder dialogue processes involving a diverse set of public and private actors. In the context of both real and simulated case studies, we will address diverse public policy issues, including civil rights, racial justice, economic inequality and natural resources management. Civil unrest as experienced recently in police-community conflicts -- such as Ferguson and Baltimore as well as in the Occupy Movement -- increase polarization among groups of residents in ways not seen in decades. The unrest sometimes produces positive results. In many instances, participants experience the divisions as intense and pervasive, yet remain optimistic that they can be resolved. These deep divisions pose significant challenges to the integrity of our democratic society and can quickly escalate to bitter contests, leaving fissures within communities for decades, and possibly resulting in major economic damage and even loss of life. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a substantial group paper and presentation analyzing a selected case (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue) and the team's internal negotiation process. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 7821) or its substantial equivalent.

LAW7825,Advanced Negotiation: Transactions,,"Advanced Negotiation takes students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar. The negotiation simulations are more complex, difficult and nuanced, and preparation time is significant. You will work as an individual lawyer or businessperson, in a lawyer-client pairing, or on a business negotiation team. You may be negotiating on behalf of corporate entities large and small, national governments, municipalities, unions and NGOs. Simulations may include critical-path supply agreements, founder/VC deals, cross-cultural medical device joint ventures, airline reorganization, big pharma global distribution deals, or multi-party private sector/government negotiations. The goals of the class emanate from developing your designer's mindset and a lawyer's instinct for effective, self-interested negotiation: from intense preparation for client counseling, to in-the-moment tactics; adroit response to changing scenarios; deeper work on persuasion, listening, question &amp; answer management; structural design &amp; process control and, ultimately, creating an intact confidence--competence feedback loop for the student qua professional negotiator. Special Instructions: Attendance and participation in all simulations and debriefing sessions are required, absent approved absence (rarely given) with ample advance notice to the instructor. A &quot;Pass&quot; grade is dependent upon this active participation, and a series of short papers and/or in-class presentations.

LAW7826,Oral Argument Workshop,,"Building on the skills developed in Federal Litigation, this simulation course will give students the unique opportunity to argue and judge pretrial motions from actual federal court cases. The instructor will provide the written briefs, and each week half the class will argue and half the class will judge a motion. Preparation will require reading the cases cited in the briefs and coming to class ready either to present an argument (attorneys) or interrogate counsel (judges). Students will critique each other both orally and in writing, and the instructor will provide oral critiques of all arguments. The goals of this class are: to train students to argue in court; to provide them with a chance to polish their public speaking skills and practice thinking on their feet; to prepare students to engage in challenging dialogue with both colleagues and future clients; and to improve self-confidence. Thus, while the context of the course is litigation, the objectives are much broader than the mastery of litigation technique. This course is not open to first year Law School students. LLM students may enroll if they have familiarity with U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

At the core of these genres are the techniques of legal research, objective and persuasive legal writing, and related legal analysis. The course presents students with realistic legal writing scenarios that they address in and out of class. Students perform legal research and prepare an analytical memorandum advising a hypothetical judge and write a short letter brief.

LAW7837,Advanced Legal Writing:  Public Interest Litigation,,"Public-interest litigation is often an uphill battle. Lawyers and clients representing public interests have difficulty prevailing even when their fact patterns are sympathetic, often because the law is either undeveloped or unsupportive. Yet when public-interest litigation does succeed it can yield profound, positive change for underserved people and causes. This class will focus on research and writing skills needed to litigate public-interest lawsuits. The class will employ readings, presentations, and class discussions to unpack analytical and rhetorical tools to persuade judges across the ideological spectrum. Students will also develop tools for interpreting and applying a wide variety of legal authorities and hone their ability to be clear and creative. Students will practice the skills they learn by preparing multiple drafts of two pleadings in a single case, and will receive detailed feedback on their writing from the instructor and their peers.

LAW7846,Elements of Policy Analysis,,"This one-credit course supports students undertaking public policy analysis projects in the Policy Lab and in other policy-based courses. The course helps students gain facility with basic policy methods and approaches common to Policy Lab practicums. The core session of the course consists of six hours of classroom instruction on a (typically the Saturday at the end of the first week of classes). The morning session emphasizes thinking like a policy analyst (as distinguished from an advocate or lawyer), scoping policy problems, promoting and assessing evidence quality, and making valid (and avoiding invalid) inferences. Students apply learning in a team-based simulation exercise on a topical policy issue.  The afternoon session introduces strategies for social change, including designing and evaluating programs that improve individual lives.  The immersive exercise typically focuses on developing and evaluating a program to reduce childhood obesity.  The course then offers a series of short workshops: (1) interviewing policy clients and other stakeholders (especially where ethnic and cultural differences may be salient), (2) policy research tools and strategies, (3) design thinking for law and policy, (4) systems thinking, (5) resources and methods for cultural competencies, and (6) policy writing. Students should attend at least three of the six workshops to receive credit for the course.  With guidance from their faculty instructors, students may then draw on the skills developed in this introductory seminar to analyze a public policy problem, develop potential strategies to address it, weigh the pros and cons of strategy options, and produce a final product that may offer options or recommendations to a policy client, suggestions for implementing such recommendations, and techniques to assess the effectiveness of implementation.  Note that the students who enroll in a Law and Policy Lab practicum for the first time are asked to participate in the full-day methods bootcamp whether or not they undertake Elements of Policy Analysis for course credit.

LAWGEN119Q,Inside the Courtroom: Criminal Justice on Trial,WAY-SI,"Although it aims to deliver justice, the American criminal legal system has wrongfully convicted thousands of innocent people. Since it began recording wrongful convictions in 1989, The National Registry of Exonerations has documented 3,284 innocent people punished for crimes they did not commit. How does the court system facilitate justice and injustice? What does a real criminal case look like from start to finish? How do the perspectives of the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the judge inform the procedures and outcomes of a criminal case? Does justice depend on race, gender, identity, and income?  This seminar will consider real case examples to foster discussion of whether an arrest is lawful, whether an accusation of crime is just, and whether eyewitness and forensic evidence is reliable. Students will read transcripts of testimony from real cases, evaluate evidence submitted as actual trial exhibits, and visit a local courthouse to witness live legal arguments. Through these materials, this seminar invites student discussion of the values and principles underlying criminal justice in the United States, including notions of fairness, justice, and freedom.

Multiple studies have reinforced the finding that between 20-25% of college women (and a similar proportion of students identifying as transgender and gender-nonconforming, as well as approximately 10% of male students) experience sexual assault carried out through force or while the victim was incapacitated. This course delves into the complex issues of sexual assault and harassment on college campuses, examining legal, policy, and political dimensions. We explore the prevalence of these issues, the historical and social contexts, and relevant laws such as Title IX and the Clery Act. Through readings spanning social science, history, literature, law, health, and journalism, we analyze responses to campus violence, considering the intersectionality of race, class, gender, and other factors. Guest speakers, including experts and advocates, provide firsthand insights. Sensitive Material: The subject matter of this course is sensitive, and students are expected to treat the material with maturity. Much of the reading and subject matter may be upsetting and/or triggering for students who identify as survivors. This course has no therapeutic component, although supportive campus resources are available for those who need them.

Working with horses requires sensitivity to nonverbal cues, discrimination in the quality and amount of physical contact, and an awareness of one's emotional state, all important skills for relating to patients. Horses give non-judgmental feedback about our personal communication styles and our ability to operate from a place of empathy and kindness. The course also teaches how to recognize subjectivity in judgment and how to overcome fear and immobility in the face of uncertainty. No riding is required and no previous horse experience is needed.

In the 1800s, missionary doctors provided medical care while also spreading religion and colonial interests.

PSYC13Q,Connections between the sleep and awake worlds,WAY-SI,"Sleep can be a window into much of our awake worlds- anxiety, depression, relationships, trauma, safety, early morning travel plans.. and so much more. If you think of a recent night in which you experienced worse sleep, you might be able to identify something from your awake world that contributed. Much of our awake world is informed by emotion, thoughts, and perception. One could argue that emotion, thoughts, and perception shape the world, rather than there being one true reality. This course will explore the fundamentals of sleep, the fundamentals of navigating emotions, and the intersection between the two. Specifically, you&iquest;ll learn the basics of human sleep science, the principles of a type of psychotherapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and how CBT tools can be applied to sleep difficulties.Break-out sessions within each lecture provide opportunities for students to ask questions and to discuss a topic in greater depth. The course will highlight the mind body connection and serve as an introduction to behavioral sleep medicine. Students will have the opportunity to complete their own project examining a sleep-wake connection of interest. Potential topics will be provided (discrimination and sleep, menstruation and sleep, high school start times, shift work and sleep, and more). As a sleep psychologist, I consider myself to be both a scientist and an artist. This course will be most interesting to those who are interested in emotions, therapeutic skills, and sleep.",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),ISS,Monday,1:30:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,,Natalie Solomon,No

Through readings, discussions and student presentations, this course journeys through theories of existence, consciousness and identity formation to offer a scaffolding for deep creative reflection and inquiry, and a springboard off which we may dive headfirst into the mysteries which both haunt us and give us life.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,ISS,"Monday, Wednesday",1:30:00 PM - 2:50:00 PM,,Giovanni Dandekar,No
PSYC63Q,Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health,,"Over 900 million individuals worldwide suffer from a mental health disorder. Human and financial costs associated with the management of individuals with mental health disorder are substantial and constitute a growing public health challenge. Yet there are presently no objective markers used to determine which individuals have a mental health disorder and predict the progression of the disorder. Furthermore, there are presently a limited number of effective treatments for mental health disorders, as well as considerable heterogeneity in treatment response. The lack of access to mental health care is yet another challenge in developed as well as developing countries. Newly available technologies such as Artificial Intelligence offer an unprecedented opportunity for developing solutions that address the aforementioned challenges and problems. In this interdisciplinary seminar, students will learn about (i) psychopathology, (ii) state-of-the-art in diagnosis and treatments of mental health disorders, (iii) unaddressed challenges and problems related to mental health, (iv) artificial intelligence and its potential through real-world examples, (v) recent real-world applications of artificial intelligence that address the challenges and problems related to mental health, and (vi) ethical issues associated with the application of artificial intelligence to mental health. Diverse viewpoints and a deeper understanding of these topics will be offered by a mix of hands-on educational sessions and panel discussions with psychiatrists, computer scientists, lawyers, and entrepreneurs. Students will also spend guided time working in small teams to develop innovative (artificial intelligence based) solutions to challenges/problems related to mental health.",3,Letter (ABCD/NP),ISS,"Tuesday, Thursday",3:00:00 PM - 4:20:00 PM,,Kaustubh Supekar,No

The early years of medical training consist primarily of didactic instruction, an almost universal challenge for students who enter medicine desiring to help and interact with patients. To increase engagement with the field, we bring clinical psychiatry to preclinical students, by interacting with patients and families, as follows. During our weekly seminar time, we interview a patient and family one week, then offer a debriefing, Q&amp;A session the following week. The seminar includes open discussion, addressing questions about specific interactions with the child/adolescent or adult, diagnoses, and therapies used for treatment. Responses to students' questions invariably address evidence-based approaches to assessment and treatment of specific disorders, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, autism, and attentional disorders. We also facilitate opportunities for the students to get involved in cutting-edge scientific research, networking/collaborating (including with medical students and faculty around the world) and attending professional conferences. The course is offered during autumn, winter and spring quarters and is intended as a longitudinal seminar to be taken continuously across these quarters.

PSYC230,How to Think Like a Shrink (PSYCH 131A),,"This course will teach you how to think (or experience) yourself and the communities around you as a therapist does. That means coming to understand why therapists focus on early life relationships and learning, why we privilege emotions, and why we see the seeming contradictions in our lives as places for deeper understanding. In class discussions, we will consider questions such as: How do our early experiences in relationships affect the ones we create later?  Why are we more likely to segregate and point fingers when we are afraid? How can we make better use of our precious capacity for attention? What good might come from anger, sadness or guilt? Projects will include looking at how the psychological phenomena we will learn about play out in public spheres and personal ones. This is not a class about mental health, but rather about the intricacy of our feeling and thinking minds. The course will be discussion-based with a focus on experiential learning, and include weekly projects that will have you playing detective in your own life.  Prerequisites include a high degree of honesty (or the desire for this), creativity and an interest in the human experience. The course may include a field trip to a sensory deprivation float tank as we study attention. At the end of the seminar, I hope you will have a greater appreciation for the complexity of your mind and reactions, and the psychology of everyday life -- personal relationships, group functioning, tiffs between political parties. My aim is to have you learn to both take yourself very seriously and not seriously at all.

It comprises the area of psychiatry concerned with the psychobiological care of the medically ill, which includes persons of all ages and those cared for in specialized medical settings including critical care units. CLP-psychiatrists, in addition to providing expert formal psychiatric consultation to medical and surgical patients in the general hospital, specialized hospitals and outpatient clinic settings, also train psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists in the recognition of normal and abnormal reactions to illness and appropriate psychological care of patients with such reactions. The CLP psychiatrist may function both as a consultant and as part of the primary medical/surgical treatment team. Via conjoint rounds and teaching conferences (primary intervention), formal consultations (secondary intervention), and involvement in inpatient treatment and discharge planning (tertiary intervention), the CLP psychiatrist provides a comprehensive approach to the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral needs of the patient. Thus, one unique feature of our program is how the members of our team are integral member of so many other medico-surgical teams throughout the medical center. Participation in this rotation should allow students to learn about diagnosis and management of psychiatric disorders common in all medical and surgical specialties, e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium, alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders. Students will accompany psychiatric residents, fellows, and faculty five days a week in performing consultations on medical-surgical and critical care units at Stanford and in performing follow-up visits. Team rounds occur every morning. Formal didactic sessions occur twice weekly. Students will learn interview technique; how to evaluate patients' psychosocial stressors and resources; how to write a cogent case report; present and discuss cases orally; work comfortably as a team member; perform differential diagnosis for depression, delirium, anxiety states, and dementia; discuss indications and contra-indications for psychotropic medications; and recognize and cope with emotional reactions to patients.

SOMGEN150Q,Challenging Sex and Gender Dichotomies in Biology and Medicine (FEMGEN 150Q),"WAY-EDP, WAY-SI","This course explores and challenges the physiological basis for distinguishing human &quot;males&quot; and &quot;females&quot;, expands the concepts of &quot;intersex&quot; beyond reproductive anatomy/physiology (i.e. beyond the genitalia), and discusses some known consequences of &quot;gender biases&quot; in medical diagnoses and treatments. The influence of gender (sociocultural) &quot;norms&quot;, i.e. gendered behaviors and relations, on human biology is juxtaposed with the role of biological traits on the construction of gender identity, roles and relationships, thereby focusing on the interactions of sex and gender on health and medical outcomes. Problems that may arise by labeling conditions that vary in incidence, prevalence and/or severity across the &quot;male-female&quot; spectrum as &quot;men's&quot; or &quot;women's&quot; health issues will be discussed. In addition, the importance of recognizing the spectrum of sex and gender, as well as sexual orientation, in clinical practice from pediatric to geriatric populations, will be highlighted, with consideration of varying perspectives within different race/ethnic, religious, political, and other groups.",3,Letter or Credit/No Credit,ISS,"Monday, Wednesday",1:30:00 PM - 2:50:00 PM,,Marcia Stefanick,Yes

How do different political systems borrow from these concepts to enhance or justify their forms of governance? How are they evolving or reforming in ways that may address the current crisis of democracy and renew public faith in the efficacy and worth of democracy? Democratic institutions are subject to a living dialogue, and we intend to engage the students in these debates, at the levels of both democratic theory and ongoing democratic practice and institutional designs.

COLLEGE113,"Utopia, Dystopia, and Technology in Science Fiction","College, THINK, WAY-A-II","We live immersed in technology but are perplexed by deep uncertainties about where technology is taking us - to a dead end or a better place? Technology has helped create utopian visions of good society while plunging societies into dystopic nightmares. Science and technology have been a universal path for all societies to join the modern world, but different cultures think about them differently. The Enlightenment ofthe West conceives scientific modernity as emancipation from religion and superstition and as a power over nature. In contrast, the traditional Chinese worldviews incorporate technology into a sacred cosmos where humans use science and technology to stay in tune with Heaven and Earth. Today, technoscience discourse has become a dominant power and ideology. Technoscientific agendas are generating class disparity,eroding the social fabric, undermining the humanist traditions, and damaging nature and climate. Science fiction thinks about how science and technology transform human society, values, and everyday experiences in ways good or bad. By projecting both utopia and dystopia, sf reveals and critiques technology-induced social malaises and keeps hopes alive by projecting better futures, testifying to the ceaseless human potential for self-renewal in sustaining civilization on Earth. This course asks the two-fold question: How can humans of diverse cultures harness technoscientific innovations while preserving humanist values and maintain a sustainable economy and civilization? How do narratives of utopia and dystopia depict the anthropocentric domination of nature and the exploitation working classes through themisuse and abuse of technology?

Artificial intelligence has been applied to improving areas of healthcare such as diagnostic tests and developing potential medical treatments.  Neurotechnologies have generated hopes of providing improved prosthetics or treatment for people with neurological and mental health disorders. However, as these biotechnologies are developed and implemented, they raise important questions regarding justice and equity. Who benefits from these advances in science and technology, and who is excluded? Is research and development in these areas proceeding in ways that are inclusive of diverse perspectives and populations? In this course, students will examine equity and justice in genomics, artificial intelligence, and neurotechnology from a global perspective. We will discuss how the medical knowledge that builds and is generated by these biotechnologies reflects and may contribute to global inequities in healthcare outcomes.

ITALIC93,Art Everywhere: How Art Moves and Moves Us,"College, THINK, WAY-A-II, WAY-CE","How does art move around the world? Most university courses in the history of the arts are divided either by geography or time period, as well as artistic discipline. But these simple distinctions are not natural to the production or reception of art itself. Although it might be easy to assume that art is made out of materials close at hand and seen or experienced chiefly by local makers, artists have often sought out distant materials and unfamiliar ideas, which are prized for their scarcity or their very distance from what is local and familiar. Historically these movements have revealed global power structures, as well as local interest and agency in ways that can be both far reaching and narrowly focused. Globalization is commonly equated with contemporary multinational corporations, from Apple to Amazon to AliExpress, but earlier periods of global exchange have also materially shaped what art is and can be. Art can reflect and reveal a global movement of peoples and ideas, as well as the raw materials that make art possible - whether words, woods, animals, minerals or melodies. We will focus in this class on a series of case studies that explore how art moves - and why these movements move artists and the people who are influenced by their work. Lectures will feature scholars and artists who address aspects of global exchange or movement in their work. In a series of workshops, students will work towards creating a genealogical project that similarly investigates how origins and movement have enabled and inspired art-making.

Ideas are often best perceived in/as 'things' that work in the spaces where words alone seem insufficient. Following this line of thought, many complicated social questions and debates are well-served in the work of artists who produce art in expedient mediums to serve their expressive ends.

Here, we examine the role played by North African countries and the Ottoman Empire in the creation of modern Italy, give an overview of Italy's (mostly failed) colonial ventures, and study the role of imperialism in the rise of Italian fascism in the 1920s. The second section of the course focuses on the region during the Cold War, and we devote particular attention to the economic and political alliances which grew between Italy and Middle Eastern countries. We will see how the former frequently sought to balance its own economic interests with the political aims of its allies in the Western Bloc. The last part of the course shifts the focus to the contemporary period by taking up issues of immigration, geopolitical conflicts in the Mediterranean, and minority communities in Italy today. During the course, we will be engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the benefits and drawbacks of the notions of &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;the Middle East&quot; in relation to Italy.

OSPFLOR61,Rinascimento Conteso: Florence's Early Modern Art Reframed,WAY-A-II,"Against the persistent myth of a triumphant Renaissance and the teleological interpretations of a supposedly optimistic period, this course focuses on the artistic production of fifteenth to sixteenth-century Florence as paradigmatic of the tensions, anxieties, and eccentric trends that emerged in Europe's visual culture during the Early Modern Age. If traditional conceptualizations of the Florentine Renaissance described it as the rebirth of naturalism, which set the canon of Western classicism, recent critical voices have revealed the tensions, ruptures, and erosions that were active underneath that surface, with profound consequences on artmaking and the world of images. Building on such debate, through direct experience and close observation of the context, these classes will propose a different narrative of mainstream Renaissance Florence. By looking with fresh eyes to painted, sculpted, and architectural works, they will reframe early modern Florentine art as a profoundly polyphonic one, which sheds light on many unsettling aspects of modernity: materialism, and the germs of historical pessimism; technology and capitalist modes of production; the fragility of nature; sensuality, tactility, and the private life of objects; the otherness of uncanny bodies; religious tensions as the expression of the individual's anxiety; the colonial appropriation of a newly expanded world. With an interest for the contaminated and the intermediate, by privileging continuities over oppositions, the course will thus offer a new understanding of the period in order to deconstruct any elitist interpretation and instead reveal its lively, diverse nature.",4,Letter (ABCD/NP),SEM,, - ,,Dario Donetti,No

How did moral visions contribute to the end of the Cold War? Were human rights construed as a universal discourse or a Western model in the globalizing world order? How have the dilemmas of war and peace been redefined in political and ethical terms? Did &quot;humanitarian interventions&quot; establish a double moral standard? Can the formulation of &quot;just war&quot; be applied to post-Cold War conflicts? The end of the Cold War and the collapse of Soviet communism in Europe and Russia will be seen as a crucial conjuncture disclosing most of the main fractures and ambiguities of our times. Specific attention will be devoted to the Western and European project to shape a world order, imagined as an extension of democratic and moral principles, and to the emergence of competing visions and resistance to such a project.

OSPMADRD89M,Building Kindness and Connection Across Cultures,,"Human beings are preternaturally collaborative, prosocial, and empathic. These abilities have allowed our species to thrive, but also evolved in an ancient social world much different than ours: in which virtually everyone we came in contact with looked like us, depended on us, and was accountable to us. At one level, modern society is more connected than ever. At another, it places new barrier - such as anonymity, otherness, and competition - in the way of true human connection. As a result, empathy has eroded; growing polarization, alienation, and animus within and between cultures are merely some of the resulting problems. Social scientists are working to recuperate social connection, using everything from virtual reality to meditation to narrative arts. In Connecting Better Across Cultures, students will explore those techniques at both a scientific and experiential level. This seminar will build on a class teach (Psych 15N: &quot;Becoming Kinder,&quot; see Stanford Video here and an op ed on the course here), but will situate its themes in a fundamentally inter-cultural space. We will review the science of empathy and prosociality, and their opposites: cruelty, hatred, and indifference.

OSPOXFRD33,E-motion About Oxford: Exploring Architecture and Art of Oxford Through Theories of Space and Affect,,"It is not a coincidence that the first president of the Stanford House was Dr Geoffrey Tyack, a renowned historian of architecture: over centuries, the setting for the intellectual and creative activities at Oxford has been as important as the activities themselves. We are embodied creatures, so space affects the way we think and the way we feel &iquest; and Oxford uniquely offers a diverse open-air classroom to examine a thousand years' development of spaces used by people for multiple purposes as well as the history of people's responses to them. Answering Juhani Pallasmaa's call voiced in his famous work The Eyes of the Skin: Architecture and the Senses, we will attempt to break away from the study of space from the exclusive perspective of discourse analysis by treating our examples holistically as multisensory objects and by experiencing them directly, in situ, as a small group of scholars. E-motion about Oxford Seminar uses the wealth of the city's heritage to achieve two main objectives: one is to help students recognise and make sense of the main artistic and architectural styles and their key ingredients; the other is to apply environmental psychology and affect theory to explore the relationship between man-made space and emotions. After all, affect arises from relationships between people, between people and spaces, and between people and objects &iquest; it's about how things make us feel through interaction.",4-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),SEM,, - ,,,No
OSPOXFRD56,Magic in the Medieval West,,"Medieval people practised magic. To think about the history of medieval magic is to think about a wide swathe of human activities and anxieties, from the prevention of illness to the pursuit of wealth, from the hunt for military glory to ensuring personal safety during travel. Magical practices were everywhere. and practised at every level of society. Medieval people also, worried about magic. The line between scholarship and heresy, the miracles of saints, and the practices of witches and necromancers was fine and contested. For some medieval thinkers, religion and magic were as obviously opposed as scientific method and magical thinking are in the twenty-first century. For others, magic was a respectable branch of learning, supported by authority and tradition, new learning from the Muslim world, and precedent from Christian teaching. Magic in the Medieval West explores this important area of medieval life. It presents the challenges and the opportunities of discovering what practices were actually followed by medieval people, what they thought others were up to, and how these related to their wider understanding of the world they inhabited. It takes advantage of the unique manuscript resources available in Oxford, the expanding body of primary sources now available in translation, and the increasingly rich scholarship on this important area of medieval social and cultural history.",4-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),SEM,, - ,,Daniel Gerrard; Ilya Afanasyev,No

OSPOXFRD85,Practical Ethics for Artificial Intelligence,WAY-ER,"AI has attracted significant attention in the last year, initially due to the release of ChatGPT, followed by backlash and efforts at creating effective regulation. Questions of ethics underlie every aspect of AI, beginning with the question of whether it is even coherent to speak of an intelligence other than humans. This course presents current ethical issues in the development and application of artificial intelligence through a series of recent case studies. We will spend the first part of the course studying major ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) and closely-linked research areas within AI and machine learning. In the second part of the course, we will apply these principles to case studies from major areas of debate in AI, with a focus on the translation of ethical principles into practical decisions.The first examples from AI we will cover are existential risks in the context of utilitarianism, the &quot;hidden&quot; labour force of AI in the context of deontology, and the problem of replacing humans in the context of virtue ethics. For the case studies, we will first study fairness and bias in the training and deployment of machine learning models. We will ask what it means for an AI system to be &quot;fair&quot;, and how to regulate models which are not interpretable. This is followed by the problems of copyright and large scale training datasets for generative AI models, where we will ask what constitutes unfair use of existing material when it is only being used to train. We continue in a more hypothetical lens with a discussion of whether or not an AI system could be a moral agent or patient, and what rights a non-human intelligence might have. Finally, we conclude with the alignment problem, where we focus on the practical challenges of value alignment and the plausibility of finding a set of values which could be universally accepted. In the last week of the course, students apply their learnings with group presentations on published academic research, unpacking the ethical questions underlying technical developments",4-5,Letter (ABCD/NP),SEM,, - ,,Andrew Bean,No

OSPPARIS99P,Paris: Capital of the Modern World,,"This course explores how Paris, between the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries, became the political, cultural, and artistic capital of the modern world. We will consider how the city has both shaped and been shaped by the tumultuous events of modern history &iquest; class conflict, industrialization, imperialism, war, occupation, and immigration. We will begin with the premise that Paris has long been a place with many overlapping and competing histories. Emerging as a national, regional, and imperial capital in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Paris was where revolutionary ideas were born and exported abroad. In the mid-nineteenth century, the city became a model of urban planning and architectural design. In the twentieth century, the city drew painters, photographers, writers, and entertainers to live and work in what many considered the center of the modern world. More recently, Paris has emerged as a postmodern, postcolonial city par excellence, facing new challenges stemming from the end of empire, economic downturn, and globalization. All the while, the city has been first and foremost a collection of neighborhoods, quartiers, where people of different classes, political orientations, nationalities, and races mingled. The stories of these people's lives &iquest; their fears, humor, pettiness, and humanity &iquest; in some ways stand at odds with the Paris famed as a center of romance, ideas, and refined culture.

SINY117,Storytelling and Human Health: An Introduction to Global Health Communication and Media Innovation,WAY-CE,"Transmitting important messages to the public, rapidly and in a compelling format, can help people to lead happier, healthier and more informed lives. We saw this during the COVID-19 pandemic, when an urgent need arose to disseminate science-based health messages to the public. Because levels of education and literacy vary, didactic and overly technical media messages often miss the audiences that need them the most. Adolescents and young adults are often among the hardest to reach with effective public health messages. At the same time, these audiences are the highest consumers of short video content via social media, presenting an interesting opportunity for public health educators.This course examines various approaches to increasing the reach and effectiveness of digital communication media for global dissemination. We will examine existing evidence-based frameworks including human-centered design, the use of narratives, entertainment-education and how we can apply the principles of universal design for learning to our efforts to engage a broad, global audience.We will also explore novel use cases for animated video interventions in global settings and innovative research methods for evaluating the effectiveness of digital health content, using large, online randomized controlled experiments. This innovative approach to measuring impact emerged out of necessity during the pandemic but is likely here to stay.Students will be exposed to the theory, science and creative process needed to create and test engaging digital communication media.

In addition to studying particular works of art, we will travel to several foundations and institutions to learn about their strategies for fostering equity and the arts.  How do art, activism and racial justice connect in performances aimed at changing ideas?  How do major arts institutions address questions of equity and difference? We will discuss how art can function as a form of aesthetic knowledge in the service of justice.  In doing so, we will grapple with the role of the creative arts in mitigating social change and study artists who have sought to intervene in the restrictive covenants of racial, gender and other segregationist or national orders.  Our case studies will shift across media, subjects, objects and temporalities.  From artists in New York responding to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the radical work of Yayoi Kusama's 1960s performances, to a plays about immigration such as Lynn Nottage's Intimate Apparel and Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton -- the latter a show that exemplifies how  art, activism and racial justice come together -- the cross-cast musical gave paid opportunities and leading parts to a full cast of performers of color while also recasting the history of immigration in the United States and produced a new form of hip hop.
