# Stanford Computer Science (CS-BS) Program

## Overview
The undergraduate program in Computer Science aims to develop students' breadth of knowledge across the subject areas of computer science, including their ability to apply the defining processes of computer science theory, abstraction, design, and implementation to solve problems in the discipline. Students take core courses in programming techniques, mathematical foundations, automata and complexity theory, systems programming, computer architecture, analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, and applications. The program prepares students for careers in government, law, and the corporate sector and for graduate study.

## Guide to Choosing Introductory Courses
Students arriving at Stanford have widely differing backgrounds and goals. The department offers several introductory courses to meet various needs:

### For General Exposure
- CS1C: Introduction to Computing at Stanford

### For Non-Technical Use
- CS101: Introduction to Computing Principles
- CS105: Introduction to Computers
Both courses meet Ways of Thinking Ways of Doing breadth requirements in Formal Reasoning.

### For Scientific/Technical Use
- CS106A: Programming Methodology (Python)
  - No prior programming experience needed
- CS106B: Programming Abstractions (C++)
  - For students with prior programming experience
  - Previous programming experience can be in any language
